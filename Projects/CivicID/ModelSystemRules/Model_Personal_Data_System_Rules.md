## Preface

This document provides Trust Framework System Rules for the provision of Personal Data and Individual Identity services. The architecture and model followed by these System Rules enables interoperability at the business, legal and technical dimensions, and ensures that each of those dimensions is expressly aligned, harmonized, and integrated.

Specifically, these System Rules anticipate and are tailored to support a prospective production grade roll out of openPDS and Funf software for Reality Analysis, and more generally, as an example of how System Rules following this model can enable and accelerate achieving the broader goal of a Personal Data Ecology. Please note that for purposes of presenting a complete and coherent reference example, “placeholders” and “hooks ” have been used for names of parties or business services. For future commercial or production grade use of these Rules, implementers would replace the example parties, service descriptions, etc., with the respective names and applicable terms specific to the business roles and relationships agreed among the parties.

# 1. BUSINESS RULES

## 1.1 Scope and Purpose

These System Rules apply to the use of the Personal Data and Individual Identity System by Individual Users, Third Party Service Providers and the System Provider, individually and in any combination. These Rules are intended and shall be interpreted to ensure that the access and interoperability enabled for access to and sharing of personal data is at all times subject to privacy protection and fair information practices.

The purpose of the System is to enable a means for individual human beings to simply, efficiently, securely and effectively exercise their rights to store and keep private their own personal data and to share access to such data by their express consent and authorization through System Services. The System is specifically intended to empower individual users to not only grant or not grant such authorizations, but also to monitor, manage and modify or revoke such access over time. The simple, efficient, secure and effective Personal Data Services are also intended to enable Third Party Service Providers to provide added value to individual Participants and derive value from access to permission-based data access in an expanded marketplace. Leveraging the capability of API’s for Third Party apps under a common rule set and services enhances the value of the system to all parties while ensuring privacy.

The issuance of individual identity credentials and related System Services is likewise intended to empower individual Participant rights and expectations of autonomy and control of their own digital identity. The information comprising the digital identifiers, attributes, tokens and other similar identity data is also considered personal data of a particularly sensitive and valuable nature, hence a compatible and beneficial set of Services to be included within this System and subject to these Rules .

The focus of these Rules is to standardize essential interface and interoperability implementation requirements necessary to ensure expected outcomes by all Parties while encouraging wide latitude for individually agreed interactions and competitively evolving innovation. These System Rules are intended to provide a reliable and efficient method of achieving the purpose of the System.

## 1.2 Parties and Roles

These System Rules are applied by and to the Parties registered as current Participants in the System Registry. Each Party, in order to be approved as a Participant, must contractually assent to the Participation Agreement, including the Terms of Agreement corresponding to the Role or Roles that Party will conduct within the System and specifically including acceptance of the rights, obligations and functions allocated to the Role or Roles agreed by each Party:

### 1.2.1 Individual Participant

An individual human being who has contractually assented to Terms of Agreement and is a customer holding a valid account with the Personal Data Store. An Individual Participant may use his or her account to request, accept and use a Grant of Authorization to access the Personal Data of another Principal Participant user.

Any individual human who contractually assents to the Terms of Agreement is eligible to apply for and hold an Account on the System. Services or other premium functions offered on a subscription, one-time fee or other billing basis are available subject to fulfillment of applicable payment terms as agreed by the Individual User.

### 1.2.2 Principal Participant

An individual human who has contractually assented to Terms of Agreement and is a customer holding a valid account with the Personal Data Store offered by the System Provider under these Rules. A Principal Participant may use his or her account to store his or her own Personal Data on the System and to Grant Authorization for accessing that Personal Data to Third Party Service Providers and/or to individual Participants.

### 1.2.3 System Provider

The Party or Parties responsible for the Personal Data System, comprised of the Personal Data Store and Services. The System Provider promulgates these System Rules.

### 1.2.4 Third Party Service Providers

The Party or Parties that operate and provide Third Party Services approved for use with the System and in accordance with these Rules. Only Third Party Providers that have been approved by the System Provider and contractually assented to the Participation Agreement, including the Terms of Agreement, are eligible to Participate in the System. Only an Approved Third Party Service Provider is eligible to receive the tokens necessary to use a Grant of Authorization by an Individual User or otherwise to use an Approved Scope and Grant Type for access of any kind to data or other resources within or through the System or otherwise subject to these Rules.

## 1.3 System Services

### 1.3.1 Service Lifecycle

Approval by the System Provider is required as a precondition to the offering of any Service though this System. Any approved Service that is currently offered through the System is enumerated in Rule 1.3.2 and is available in accordance with the technical specifications defined under Rule 3.2 and subject to all relevant Rules and used subject to the relevant provisions of the Terms of Agreement of any Participant using the Service.

### 1.3.2 System Service

Every Third Party Service must be implemented so as to ensure creation, accuracy, integrity, preservation and accessibility of Required Records such that upon review an objectively verifiable account can be made of the relevant transactions or other actions, the salient terms (i.e. the data accessed, modified or deleted or other essential terms) the parties involved, the relevant times, and the applicable Terms of Agreement and Terms of Authorization.

## 1.5 Use of System Logo and Marketing

Any use of the System Logo, and any marketing, advertising or other public communications referencing approved Third Party Provider status or other affiliation with this System is prohibited unless explicitly permitted in the applicable Terms of Agreement and only for such time as the Terms of Agreement are in effect.

# 2. LEGAL RULES

## 2.1 Scope and Application

### 2.1.1 Promulgation of Rules

The content comprising the “System Rules” duly promulgated by the System Provider in accordance with these Rules, is the formal and binding normative version of these Rules as of the moment of publication and until the moment of publication of a subsequent version or for such period of time as provided under these Rules.

### 2.1.2 Order of Precedence

In the event of a conflict between the provisions of these Rules and the provisions of the Terms of Agreement between any Parties to these Rules, then the provisions of these Rules shall prevail.

In the event of a conflict between the terms of these Rules and an Independent Commercial Contract between any Parties to these Rules, then, as between a Principal Participant and a Third Party Service Provider, the provisions of the applicable Terms of Authorization incorporated by reference into the Parties Terms of Agreement shall prevail, and otherwise the provision of the Independent Commercial Contract shall prevail.

## 2.2 Rights and Obligations of Participants

### 2.2.1 General Obligation

All Participants agree to abide by the terms and act in accordance with these Rules and adhere to respect each Principal Participant’s ownership and control rights to their own Personal Data stored in or accessible through this System.

### 2.2.2 Protection and Promotion of Individual Participant Identity and Data Rights

The System Provider is responsible for safeguarding the Individual Participant’s elemental rights to his or her own individual identity and ownership of their personal data and may as appropriate protect and defend such rights and as needed represent the interests of such Participant vis-a-vis external parties when such rights are threatened.

### 2.2.3 Minimum Required Obligations of Third Party Providers to individual Participants

Each Third Party Provider agrees to comply with the Terms of Authorization between itself and each individual Participant from whom the Third Party Provider has received a Grant of Authorization for access to personal data of such Participant

To ensure the purpose of this System and expectations of individual Participants are met, every Third Party Provider must correctly and completely implement the Approved Scopes and Grant Types and corresponding obligations and stipulations for each such Scope and Grant. Furthermore, every Third Party Provider must agree to accept that the legal rights and obligations corresponding to each Approved Scopes and Grant Types are contractually enforceable by the Participant that has granted such Authorization to such Third Party Provider or by the System Provider as a Third Party Beneficiary. Failure to comply with these requirements renders any Third Party Provider ineligible for Participation and subject to termination, suspension, or a review process at the sole discretion of the System Provider.

To be eligible for approval by the System Provider, a prospective Third Party Provider must submit a Third Party Provider Application, including truthful, accurate and complete information. Every Third Party Provider must contractually assent to abide by and in practice adhere to these Rules. Manual Registration of a Third Party Service, Client or Other App is required. Any approved Third Party Provider may accept individual Participant Grants of Authorization corresponding to one or more Approved Scope and Grant Type for access to that Participant’s Personal Data.

Any approved Third Party Provider may establish such additional terms of service, including with respect to billing, liability and service quality, with individual Participants of the System, as the parties may agree provided that no contractual term or other obligation shall be enforceable against any individual Participant to the extent the obligation arises from or applies to that Participant ‘s Grant of Authorization to the Third Party Provider and is inconsistent with any provision of these Rules.

## 2.3 Logging and Reporting

### 2.3.2 Recording With System Registry

## 3.3 Approved Scopes of User Authorization and Grant Types

Only requests for access to Personal Data that conform with the defined Approved Scopes and Grant Types are permitted or supported under these Rules.

## 3.4 Security and Resilience

Passwords: Only an Individual User’s Account password can decrypt that user’s Personal Data or other sensitive information, and System Provider does not store this password. As a result, no one—not even System Provider employees—can see the sensitive information a Principal User places in the System. If a Principal User forgets his or her password and needs to reset it, the System Provider shall delete that user’s sensitive information for his or her own protection. System Provider must also have mechanisms in place to stop brute force attacks on passwords, and offer multi-factor authentication and secure password recovery

Servers: Personal Data is stored in a major U.S. server storage facility that has 24/7 security guards and biometric security for entry, has been issued an SSAE16 Type II SOC 1 Report, is a PCI Security Standards Council Member, is Safe Harbor Certified, and offers protection via firewalls, its own intrusion detection systems, and other measures.

Data Storage: All personal data are encrypted in database servers, including by the use of 256-bit AES encryption and RSA 2048 asymmetric key encryption. Personal Data containing sensitive information must be encrypted uniquely, in order to add an extra layer of security. Non-sensitive information may only be accessed through a Principal User-chosen password that must not be stored by the System Provider. While technically possible for a small and limited group of System operations employees to access non-sensitive information, they are strictly forbidden from doing so, consistent with System Provider policies and these Rules, unless required by law, and access to System Provider servers is carefully logged.

Secure Coding and Data Management Practices: System Provider shall not use insecure third-party delivery networks, and must ensure that Principal User Personal Data is never exposed. System Provider is not permitted to see Principal User Personal Data even in the context of crash reports. In addition, System Provider must not use data de-duplication methods, which can raise security and privacy concerns.

Security Testing and Certificates: System Provider conducts audits of System security, including penetration testing by outside firms. System Provider uses SSL certificates from VeriSign and GeoTrust. In addition, System Provider constantly monitors the System for potential threats and vulnerabilities.

Principal’s Control Their Personal Data: Only a Participant account holder can grant individuals, companies or applications access to his or her Personal Data and permanently delete or export his or her Personal Data. Third Party Providers are not allowed to track Participants while they are on the System, and the System Provider does not track Participants when they leave the System or a mobile app that is part of the System.

System Provider Employees: All System Provider employees undergo background checks going back 10 years as a condition of employment, and all technical employees receive security training.

## 3.5 Testing and Change Management

The System makes available a sandbox and test harness to Third Party Provider applicants to test the readiness for business, legal and technical interoperability with other Participants and for Participants to text readiness of modified or new Services, Transactions or other functions.
