Welcome to THE SEDONA GUIDELINES: Best Practice Guidelines & Commentary for Managing Information &
Records in The Electronic Age (2nd Edition) (“The Sedona Guidelines”), the second publication in The Sedona
Conference® Working Group Series (the “WGS®”). The WGS® is designed to bring together some of the nation’s
finest lawyers, consultants, academics and jurists to address current problems in the areas of antitrust law, complex
litigation and intellectual property rights that are either ripe for solution or in need of a “boost” to advance law and
policy. (See Appendix H for further information about The Sedona Conference® in general, and the WGS® in
particular). The WGS® output is published and widely distributed for review, critique and comment. Following a
period of peer review, we revise and republish the original piece, taking into consideration what has been learned
during the comment period. The Sedona Conference® hopes and anticipates that the output of its working groups
will evolve into authoritative statements of law and policy, both as they are and as they ought to be.
The first subject tackled by The Sedona Conference® Working Group on Best Practices for Electronic Document
Retention and Production (“WGS 1”) was electronic document production in the context of litigation. That effort
resulted in The Sedona Principles: Best Practices, Recommendations & Principles for Addressing Electronic Document
Discovery (2005) (originally published in 2003 for public comment), which was revised and re-published in June of
2007 as The Sedona Principles, Second Edition: Best Practices, Recommendations & Principles for Addressing Electronic
Document Discovery.
This document addresses the related and arguably larger questions related to the management of electronic
information in organizations as a result of business, statutory, regulatory and legal needs. The subject of information
management and record retention is of critical importance in the digital age and the subject of many treatises
and publications, yet the members and participants of the Working Group believed there was a need to distill existing
thoughts and, in doing so, reach across the boundaries of legal compliance, records management and information
technology. The Steering Committee and participants of WGS 1 are to be congratulated for their efforts developing
these guidelines and their continued dedication to the project since the first meeting in October of 2002. I especially
want to acknowledge the contributions of Jonathan Redgrave in organizing and leading the Working Group.
The peer review period is an important part of the balanced development of these guidelines and commentary. This
document, in its original form, was published for a six month public comment period on September 1, 2004, and
following substantial re-writing, presentation and discussion at various forums, a final version was published in
September 2005. Additional case law developments, and the adoption of the amendments to the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure related to electronically stored information, caused the editorial board to re-visit the 2005 publication,
and the result here is an updated look at information and records management in the electronic world.
The Working Group in the future will continue to publish “commentaries” and other work product targeting specific
issues and developments in the area of information and records management. Details of these activities are regularly
posted on The Sedona Conference® website (www.thesedonaconference.org).

The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                    November 2007


           The Sedona Guidelines for Managing Information
                           & Records in The Electronic Age
1.    An organization should have reasonable policies and procedures for managing its information and records.

      a.    Information and records management is important in the electronic age.

      b.    The hallmark of an organization’s information and records management policies should be reasonableness.

      c.    Defensible policies need not mandate the retention of all information and documents.

2.   An organization’s information and records management policies and procedures should be realistic, practical
     and tailored to the circumstances of the organization.

      a.    No single standard or model can fully meet an organization’s unique needs.

      b.    Information and records management requires practical, flexible and scalable solutions that address the
            differences in an organization’s business needs, operations, IT infrastructure and regulatory and legal
            responsibilities.

      c.    An organization must assess its legal requirements for retention and destruction in developing an
            information and records management policy.

      d.    An organization should assess the operational and strategic value of its information and records in
            developing an information and records management program.

      e.    A business continuation or disaster recovery plan has different purposes from those of an information and
            records management program.

3.    An organization need not retain all electronic information ever generated or received.

      a.    Destruction is an acceptable stage in the information life cycle; an organization may destroy or delete
            electronic information when there is no continuing value or need to retain it.

      b.    Systematic deletion of electronic information is not synonymous with evidence spoliation.

      c.    Absent a legal requirement to the contrary, organizations may adopt programs that routinely delete certain
            recorded communications, such as electronic mail, instant messaging, text messaging and voice-mail.

      d.    Absent a legal requirement to the contrary, organizations may recycle or destroy hardware or media that
            contain data retained for business continuation or disaster recovery purposes.

      e.    Absent a legal requirement to the contrary, organizations may systematically delete or destroy residual,
            shadowed or deleted data.

      f.    Absent a legal requirement to the contrary, organizations are not required to preserve metadata; but may
            find it useful to do so in some instances.

The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                  November 2007

4.   An organization adopting an information and records management policy should also develop procedures that
     address the creation, identification, retention, retrieval and ultimate disposition or destruction of information
     and records.

      a.   Information and records management policies must be put into practice.

      b.   Information and records management policies and practices should be documented.

      c.   An organization should define roles and responsibilities for program direction and administration within
           its information and records management policies.

      d.   An organization should guide employees regarding how to identify and maintain information that has a
           business purpose or is required to be maintained by law or regulation.

      e.   An organization may choose to define separately the roles and responsibilities of content and technology
           custodians for electronic records management.

      f.   An organization should consider the impact of technology (including potential benefits) on the creation,
           retention and destruction of information and records.

      g.   An organization should recognize the importance of employee education concerning its information and
           records management program, policies and procedures.

      h.   An organization should consider conducting periodic compliance reviews of its information and records
           management policies and procedures, and responding to the findings of those reviews as appropriate.

      i.   Policies and procedures regarding electronic management and retention should be coordinated and/or
           integrated with the organization’s policies regarding the use of property and information, including
           applicable privacy rights or obligations.

      j.   Policies and procedures should be revised as necessary in response to changes in workforce or
           organizational structure, business practices, legal or regulatory requirements and technology.

5.    An organization’s policies and procedures must mandate the suspension of ordinary destruction practices and
      procedures as necessary to comply with preservation obligations related to actual or reasonably anticipated
      litigation, government investigation or audit.

      a.   An organization must recognize that suspending the normal disposition of electronic information and
           records may be necessary in certain circumstances.

      b.   An organization’s information and records management program should anticipate circumstances that will
           trigger the suspension of normal destruction procedures.

      c.   An organization should identify persons with authority to suspend normal destruction procedures and
           impose a legal hold.

      d.   An organization’s information and records management procedures should recognize and may describe the
           process for suspending normal records and information destruction and identify the individuals
           responsible for implementing a legal hold.

      e.   Legal holds and procedures should be appropriately tailored to the circumstances.




                                                                                                                      v
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                     November 2007




      f.   Effectively communicating notice of a legal hold should be an essential component of an organization’s
           information and records management program.

      g.   Documenting the steps taken to implement a legal hold may be beneficial.

      h.   If an organization takes reasonable steps to implement a legal hold, it should not be held responsible for
           the acts of an individual acting outside the scope of authority and/or in a manner inconsistent with the
           legal hold notice.

      i.   Legal holds are exceptions to ordinary retention practices and when the exigency underlying the hold no
           longer exists (i.e., there is no continuing duty to preserve the information), organizations are free to lift
           the legal hold.

The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                                                                               November 2007



                                                                                                                                                              Preface
Today most information created and received in organizations of all sizes is generated electronically in the form of
e-mail messages and their attachments, word processing or spreadsheet documents, webpages, databases and the like.1
Even formal documents—such as tax returns, applications for permits and other documents filed with regulatory
authorities—generally originate and often are filed in electronic format. Much of the information is never reduced to
paper. Meanwhile, because of how computers operate, vast amounts of electronic data are created and maintained–
seemingly forever–often without users even knowing that the data has been created, much less saved. Yet while this
data is kept “seemingly forever,” due to changes in technology, it may rapidly become inaccessible unless migrated to
new formats.2
This document explores how the prevalence of electronic information affects traditional concepts of records
management and applicable legal requirements. It suggests basic guidelines, commentary and illustrations to help
organizations develop sound and defensible processes to manage electronic information and records.
The guidelines do not specify precise technical means to implement these approaches. Appropriate technical solutions
can be devised only after the essential elements of a program are designed, and after reviewing the organization’s
operations, risk and regulatory environment and information technology (IT) structure. In all likelihood, after such
analysis, the application of the guidelines and the particular solutions employed will vary greatly among and even
within organizations.
We examine electronic information and records management from three different perspectives–legal, records
management and information technology–with legal considerations being our primary focus. In doing so, we
recognize that obligations of the litigation process—such as the duty to preserve information that is, or may become,
discoverable—differ from the operational needs as well as any of the statutory, regulatory and other legal obligations
which form the basis for records management. In large organizations, these three views are often represented by
various (and perhaps well-funded) constituencies; in smaller ones, a single individual may perform two or even all
three roles and the resources available may be limited. Regardless of an organization’s size, an effective approach to
electronic information and records management should consider all three perspectives and requires appropriate
compromises in reaching the best possible solution for an organization.
One may view this document as a type of digital age Rosetta Stone,3 helping translate and harmonize legal, records
management and technical jargon and concepts for managing electronic information and records. But, like
that ancient stone tablet, this document is not a radical or breakthrough paradigm for managing information and
records. The Working Group readily acknowledges that others have promulgated various standards, practices and
treatises on retention issues—including those for electronic records—and we do not seek to recreate wheels already
invented. That said, the guidelines address these issues from a unique multidisciplinary perspective that we believe
will help the various constituencies within an organization better understand their obligations and each other, and help
persons outside the organization understand the complex and unique issues involved in managing electronic
information and records.

  In 2004, the U. S. National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) announced the award of a contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation for the agency’s new Electronic Records
Archive (ERA), which was launched as a project in 1998. http://www.archives.gov/era/about/index.html#background. The goals for the system are to “capture electronic information,
regardless of its format, save it permanently, and make it accessible on whatever hardware or software is currently in use.” http://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2004/nr04-73.html.
While a functional subset of the ERA is expected to become operational sometime in 2008, full implementation will take years and, even if it proves successful, only answers the question
of “how” to store electronic records and not “what” to retain.

  The Rosetta Stone is a basalt slab discovered by Napoleon’s soldiers in 1799 in Rosette (Raschid), Egypt. Carved in 196 B.C., it contains a decree of the priests of Memphis honoring
the Egyptian Pharaoh Ptolemy V, appearing in hieroglyphs (the script of official and religious texts), Demotic (the script of everyday Egyptian language), and Greek. Because the Rosetta
Stone contained the same text in three different scripts, for the first time in 1822 Jean Francois Champollion was able to use it to unlock the mystery of hieroglyphics. Then with the aid
of his understanding of the Coptic language (the language of the Christian descendants of the ancient Egyptians), Champollion also discovered the phonetic value of the hieroglyphs,
proving they had more than symbolic meaning, but also served as a “spoken language.”

                                                                                                                                        Introduction
Management of Information and Records in a World of Electronic Documents and Data

The “computer revolution” has brought about momentous change over the past twenty years in the way society creates,
communicates and stores information. Yet, laws and policies have been very slow to adapt to this new paradigm
involving immense volumes, high volatility and great mobility of electronic information. Moreover, lacking
appropriate guidance, individual organizations have been slow to identify management solutions to the problems
associated with the undifferentiated and uncontrolled growth of transmitted and stored data.5
This document harmonizes the legal, policy and technical considerations that bear on and should be considered by
every public and private organization in today’s electronic age. In particular, this publication sets forth “guidelines” to
help organizations assess their unique needs and responsibilities in managing electronic information and records.
Supporting each guideline is detailed commentary and citations to case law and pertinent trade literature to assist
organizations in addressing these issues.6
In terms of structure, these guidelines focus on two distinct situations involved in the management of electronic
information and records. The first, and the bulk of the document, is comprised of guidelines that address the
statutory, regulatory and other legal obligations needed to manage and retain valuable information as an ongoing
business matter. See Guidelines 1-4. The second addresses the responsibilities triggered by actual or reasonably
anticipated litigation and government investigation when all types of relevant information must be preserved,
regardless of whether that information has been identified as “records.” See Guideline 5.
             1. What Is a “Guideline”?
These guidelines distill respected philosophies and doctrines advocated by various treatises, white papers and studies, as
well as real world experiences of The Sedona Conference® Working Group participants. The guidelines represent a
framework for organizations to (a) evaluate their policies, practices and procedures, and (b) work towards “best
practices” for managing information.
Significantly, these guidelines are premised on an understanding that developing and implementing an organization’s
best practices should be an ongoing process and not simply a momentary project that produces a document. To that
end, these guidelines are not strict “standards” and may not apply in all situations. Instead, they are intended to
provide guidance to organizations in determining a course of action throughout the challenging process of managing
electronic information and records.
             2. “Managing”7 Information and Records
From a traditional records management perspective8 information should be retained as long as it has value to an

Messages as Records (ARMA/ANSI 9-2004: Oct. 7, 2004). See also Retention Management for Records and Information (ANSI/ARMA 8-2005: Feb. 7, 2005); cf. Randolph A. Kahn and

  Throughout this document we use the term “information and records management” to refer to the process by which an organization generates (or receives), retains, retrieves and destroys
tangible (paper or electronic) information. This “management” may be through highly detailed policies, procedures and records retention schedules, or it may be without such detail. But
whatever the terms or methods employed, there are certain benefits and risks attached to these active and passive decisions, which each organization should consider and balance in its best
judgment in relation to its own circumstances.
8
  The traditional concept of “managing” information and records arose from practices related to paper records and, in large part, the management of inactive paper records (i.e., records
that were no longer actively used in the business but retained some value or fell within a legal requirement to retain the records). Records management as a discipline evolved to include
paper document generation and management, and is now faced with the challenge of adjusting to the new paradigm of electronic information and records. As noted elsewhere, this
challenge is exacerbated by the fact that hardware and software systems were not—and even today largely are not—designed with consideration of records retention policies and
requirements.


                                                                                                                                                                                             1
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                                                                                   November 2007

organization, or is required by law or regulation to be retained.9 Stated simply, this means that organizations must
retain certain information when:
       •      A local, state or federal law or regulation mandates continued availability and accessibility;
       •      Internal organizational requirements, including policies and contracts or other record-keeping requirements,
              mandate retention, such as records for tax purposes; or
       •      The information is worthy of retention because it has other value to the organization.
In addition, organizations must take steps to preserve certain information if it is relevant to actual or reasonably
anticipated litigation, subpoenas or government investigative requests, regardless of whether it meets any of the
preceding criteria or constitutes a formal “record” of the organization. If, and only if, information does not meet the
above criteria requiring retention or preservation, then it may be destroyed10 and in some cases must be destroyed.11
The legitimacy of managing information and records through document and information management policies that
systematically destroy (as well as retain) information has been long recognized by lower courts and, in 2005, was
acknowledged by the United States Supreme Court. In the Arthur Andersen decision, the Court noted that
“‘[d]ocument retention policies’ … are common in business” and added that those policies “are created in part to keep
certain information from getting into the hands of others, including the Government.”12 The Court further
emphasized that “[i]t is, of course, not wrongful for a manager to instruct his employees to comply with a valid
document retention policy under ordinary circumstances.” Arthur Andersen, LLP v. United States, 544 U.S. 696,
125 S. Ct. 2129, 2135 (2005).13
These basic records management concepts, including the expectation that organizations will appropriately destroy
information, apply equally to all forms of information, including electronic data. The challenge confronting
organizations, and the objective of these guidelines and accompanying commentary, is to fashion rules, policies and
programs for managing information that are feasible, effective and defensible.
             3. Understanding the Distinction Between “Information” and “Records”
A prerequisite to effective management is an understanding of what is being managed. “Information” in its broadest
sense is a basic resource that organizations harness to meet their operational, legal, historical and institutional needs.
Every day selected pieces of “information” are captured as “documents” or “data,” giving otherwise intangible resources
tangible form and enhancing the ability to access and share them. Although “information” can refer to everything
from the CEO’s thoughts on next quarter’s forecast (intangible) to telephone message slips (tangible), throughout this
document the word “information” will be used to refer generally to all of an organization’s tangible documents and
data—in both electronic and other formats and irrespective of the classification as records.

 The records management profession defines the various values of information to organizations as “legal values,” “fiscal values,” “operational values,” and/or “historical values.” See
ARMA Glossary of Records and Information Management Terms (ANSI/ARMA 10-1999: Sept. 26, 2000).
10
  As set forth herein, there is legitimate debate regarding whether to describe the end (last) stage of a record’s “life” as “disposal” or “destruction.” There is great merit to the proposition
that the broader term “disposal” is better for it encompasses many possible actions and it is not as pejorative as “destruction.” This document does not, however, take a position on such
nomenclature because the important point that must be understood is that organizations can, do and should take steps to eliminate information that need not be retained, whether that is
called “destruction,” “deletion,” “disposal,” “shredding,” or the like.
11
   Indeed, in a world of unforeseen access to data and data loss (see, e.g., Sasha Talcott, Bank Data Loss May Affect 60 Officials, Boston Globe, Feb. 27, 2005, at A8 (detailing loss of backup
tapes by Bank of America containing sensitive information, including Social Security numbers, for 1.2 million accounts)), there is an increasing need to ensure the secure destruction of
data, such as personal and financial records, after the retention or preservation periods have expired. For example, in its 2005 complaint against BJ’s Wholesale Club, the FTC raised the
issue of what constitutes an appropriate retention period for personal information. In its complaint the FTC alleged BJ’s “created unnecessary risks to the [personal customer] information
by storing it for up to 30 days when it no longer had a business need to keep the information…” (In the matter of BJ’s Wholesale Club, Inc., FTC Docket No. C-4148, 2005). Additionally,
the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (“FACTA”) became law in December 2003. Pub. L. No. 108-159 117 Stat. 1952. Section 216 of the Act required the Federal
Trade Commission (“FTC”) and other federal agencies to issue regulations governing the disposal of consumer credit information. The FTC final rule became effective on June 1, 2005,
and creates broad responsibilities for companies that use or handle information subject to the rule. See 16 C.F.R. § 682, et seq. Section 682.3(a) of the rule states that “[a]ny person who
maintains or otherwise possesses consumer information for a business purpose must properly dispose of such information by taking reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized
access to or use of the information in connection with its disposal.” 16 C.F.R. § 682.3(a).

   Arthur Andersen, LLP v. United States, 544 U.S. 696, 125 S. Ct. 2129, 2135 (2005). Importantly, it must be noted that the Supreme Court’s decision did not endorse the actions or
Arthur Andersen, LLP v. United States, 544 U.S. 696, 125 S. Ct. 2129, 2135 (2005). policies of Arthur Andersen related to its Enron-related document destruction activities that led to the
criminal indictment in the first place. Instead, the Court’s holding was limited to a reversal of the conviction on the basis that the jury instruction used was impermissibly broad and
failed to convey the requisite level of culpability required under the then-existing statute, which had subsequently been amended as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

“Records” are a special subset of “information” deemed to have some enduring value to an organization and warranting
special attention concerning retention, accessibility and retrieval.14 44 U.S.C. § 3301 (2000). This declaration of value
can be by operation of law and/or by specific classification by the organization. Usually, the culling process:
      (a) Looks at content regardless of form (electronic or paper);
      (b) Focuses on the operational activities of the organization;
      (c) Involves a policy level decision by the organization as to what information has sufficient value to be designated
          as a “record”;
      (d) Establishes a process by which “records” will be identified, and set aside and maintained, such that a record
          can be accessed and that the authenticity of the information as a business record can be readily established;
          and
      (e) Institutes a means by which the “non-record” and “record” information will be systematically destroyed after it
          is no longer of value.
This culling of records from the universe of information requires management, manifested through policies, practices
and education.
The unique characteristics of electronic data (as compared with paper) present unprecedented new challenges for
records and information management. For example, the sheer volume of electronic communications today (such as
e-mail) makes it virtually impossible for individual employees to sift and match content with lengthy records retention
schedules. This leads to dual problems. On the one hand, even though much of the stored and exchanged
information has only short term business value and no “record value” (for example, broadcast announcements of
company social events), it may remain within the technology systems of the organization indefinitely. On the other
hand, the inability to isolate and protect information of enduring value may lead to the inadvertent loss of that
information to the detriment of the organization. The problem is compounded by the reality that, as of August 2005,
despite many efforts to move towards centralized data, it was estimated that eighty-five percent (85%) of corporate
data resides in unstructured formats outside of databases.15
In addition, the proliferation of “non-traditional” records within relational databases and other enterprise-wide data
applications presents challenges in terms of record ownership, fixing points in time when the data should be
considered to be a record, and cost-benefit analyses on disposition of data in accordance with records schedules.
As described in the included commentary, effectively classifying, retaining and destroying electronic information and
records requires a combination of technical and process management solutions adapted to the unique circumstances of
the organization.

             4. Existing Resources to Analyze and Guide the Management of Electronic Information and Records

Appropriate management of information and records is driven by two primary sources: (a) statutory, regulatory and
other legal principles (“the law”), and (b) professional standards.

“[R]ecords” includes all books, papers, maps, photographs, machine readable materials, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by
an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its
legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government or because of the informational value of

The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                                                                           November 2007

Legal Principles: Legal guidance is embodied in a wide variety of statutes and regulations establishing record-keeping
requirements for organizations based on their locations, business operations and activities, which typically draw no
distinction between electronic and paper records. Most statutes and regulations encompass both electronic and
traditional paper records in their definitions of “document” or “record,” the exception being state security breach
notification laws, many of which reference only electronically stored data. In recent years, federal, state and local
regulations have given organizations considerable latitude in maintaining their records in either paper or electronic
form. See, e.g., Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.A. § 3501, et seq.) (West 2005).
In addition, the common law creates obligations to preserve evidence (whether designated as records or not) when
actual or reasonably anticipated litigation is involved.
Professional Standards: Many trade and service organizations recommend that their members follow published
standards and technical papers addressing records and information management issues. Furthermore, within certain
industries, trade practices regarding data capture and retention may become standards for all industry members.
Organizations issuing guidance in this area include ANSI (American National Standards Institute), AIIM (Association
for Information and Image Management), ARMA International (Association of Records Managers and
Administrators) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization). Over 80 standards, recommended
practices and technical reports issued by AIIM have been approved by the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI). ANSI has promulgated additional national standards including, for example, storage of magnetic and optical
media for records management purposes—ANSI Standard IT9.23-1998. Similarly, ARMA International and ISO are
accredited international standards development organizations that issue standards and reports regarding records and
information management.
In 2001, ISO sought an international consensus standard for records management, including electronic records, in its
guidance document ISO Technical Report 15489-2 (Information and Documentation—Records Management (2001))
and its accompanying standard, ISO 15489-1.16 The standard establishes requirements to consider an organization’s
regulatory environment in setting records retention and disposition policies and procedures. See ISO 15489-1,
Clause 5. The standard recognizes that there are various methods to analyze operational functions to determine
records management requirements, and the Technical Report is an explicit (but not exclusive) example. Nevertheless,
despite its breadth, there is no established mechanism to certify compliance with ISO 15489-1.
In 2005, ISO issued Technical Report 18492 (Long-Term Preservation of Electronic Document-Based Information). This
technical report establishes a general framework for strategy development that can be applied to a broad range of
public and private sector electronic document-based information for the long-term preservation of usable and
trustworthy electronic records.17
The organizations mentioned above take different and sometimes overlapping approaches to the issue, but all agree
that standards are essential to manage electronic records. However, these organizations generally do not address
specific litigation-oriented evidence preservation duties, a critical consideration in the United States (and increasingly
in other countries as “American-style” litigation practices are exported overseas), that we address in Guideline 5 and its
accompanying text.

   ISO/TR 15489-2 seeks to provide a “benchmark” for “best practice” in record systems and practices, regardless of medium or format. This standard is available for purchase from the
ISO online at www.iso.ch/iso/en/prods-services/ISOstore/store.html or from the ARMA bookstore at www.arma.org/bookstore/index.cfm. Australia has incorporated ISO/TR 15489-2 in
its national standard for management of all records (Australian Standard AS ISO 15489 issued in 2002 replacing its groundbreaking standard AS 4390 issued in 1996). Other countries
are considering adoption of the ISO standard as well, as reported in ISO’s 2003 international conference report available at as reported in ISO’s 2003 international conference report
available at http://www.iso.org/iso/en/commcentre evenevenets/archives/2003/armaiso15489.html. An excellent summary of this ISO 2003 international conference report is available at

   ISO Technical Report 18492 is based on the concept that electronic information constitutes the “business memory” of daily business actions or events. Following that premise, the
retention and preservation of this “business memory” would seem desirable to support current and future management decisions, satisfy customers, achieve regulatory compliance, and
protect against adverse litigation. Key issues in long-term preservation of electronic document-based information that are addressed in the document include the obsolescence of hardware
and software and the limited life of many digital storage media. See also Charles M. Dollar, Authentic Electronic Records: Strategies for Long-Term Access (Cohasset Associates 2002).




                                                                                                                                                                                      4
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                                                                              November 2007

Apart from the standards and guidelines offered by standards and trade organizations,18 many consultants, vendors
and software companies offer solutions to the complex questions involved in managing information and records in the
electronic age. Some even provide white papers and technical reports to assist organizations researching solutions in
the area (often free-of-charge as downloads from their website). However, it is important to read such information
with a critical eye towards determining whether the recommendations advocate a narrow approach to information
management tied to the solutions offered by the vendor/author and will be practical in the particular organization.
There is no single standard or universal policy that can be applied as a talisman to guide future conduct or judge the
wisdom of prior practices for any given organization. Instead, there is a continuum of possible models, all or many of
which may allow an organization to meet its unique business and legal needs. And there are infinite combinations of
these approaches that may fall within the boundaries of reasonable, defensible and good management practices. As
such, the guidelines in this document do not mandate how an organization should manage its information and
records. Rather, they highlight issues to consider, as well as possible steps to implement “best practices” for that
organization.
             5. Potential Benefits From Effective Information and Records Management
In assessing its information and records management needs, and in deciding what resources to commit, an
organization may wish to consider the following possible benefits of an effective information and records management
program:
       •     Facilitating easier and more timely identification of and access to necessary information;
       •     Controlling the creation and growth of information;
       •     Reducing operating and storage costs;
       •     Improving efficiency and productivity;
       •     Incorporating information and records management technologies as they evolve;
       •     Meeting statutory and regulatory retention obligations;
       •     Facilitating statutory notification requirements in the event of a security breach involving personal
             information;
       •     Meeting litigation presentation obligations, which may be broader and more extensive than the organization’s
             other records management obligations;
       •     Protecting the integrity and availability of business critical information;
       •     Leveraging information capital and making better decisions; and
       •     Preserving corporate history and memory, including evidence to support corporate governance and
             compliance initiatives.
While the potential benefits are difficult to quantify precisely, the emerging consensus in the literature and anecdotal
experience of Working Group members lead us to conclude that organizations that comprehensively address electronic
data issues in their policies and practices are much better positioned to meet their legal duties (regulatory as well as in
litigation) and are also more likely to maximize the value of internal business data.
             6. Potential Consequences of Inadequately Managing Information and Records in the Electronic Age
An organization may also wish to consider the possible risks of not actively managing electronic information and
records, such as:

  Various other current standards and guidelines known to the authors of these Guidelines are set out in Appendix B. Most of the identified standards focus on technical issues relating to
the use of alternative media for storing records and not on records retention issues.




                                                                                                                                                                                         5
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                                                                              November 2007

          •     Inability to retrieve and productively use business critical information on a daily or historic basis;
          •     Loss of strategic opportunities due to the inability to recognize or leverage valuable information;
          •     Increased costs of doing business from inefficiencies related to disparate or inaccessible data;
          •     Failure to comply with statutory or regulatory retention and destruction requirements;
          •     Failure to comply with security breach notification requirements;
          •     Reduced ability to comply with court orders and other litigation-related imperatives requiring access to
                existing information; and
          •     Inability to respond promptly to government inquiries.
The consequences of a failure will vary depending upon the circumstances, but could range from minor to
       catastrophic:
          •     Lost business;
          •     Lost profits;
          •     Regulatory fines and penalties, which have recently reached eight figure amounts;19
          •     Civil litigation consequences, such as increased litigation costs, fines,20 adverse inference instructions,21 default
                judgment,22 and civil contempt;23
          •     Vicarious liability for responsible senior management;24 and
          •     Criminal liability for organizations25 and individuals.26
The key management challenge is to weigh the benefits (both in terms of goals achieved and risks diminished) against
the potential costs of the various approaches to managing electronic documents and records. This is often described as
a “cost-benefit” or ROI (i.e., return on investment) analysis. The increased scrutiny in the regulatory and litigation
arenas, combined with the significant complexities of managing electronic information and records, can substantially
affect ROI calculations, weighing in favor of more sophisticated management approaches.

   Importantly, even though Arthur Andersen may have been successful in its appeal to the United States Supreme Court (see Arthur Andersen, LLP v. United States, 544 U.S. 596,
125 S. Ct. 2129 (2005)), that decision was limited to the reversal based on an erroneous jury instruction and interpreted a statute that has since been amended. Moreover, 18 U.S.C.
§ 1519, enacted as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, is broader than the statutory section at issue in Arthur Andersen and prohibits the knowing destruction of documents “in
relation to or contemplation of ” “any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States.” See infra note 26. In opposing certiorari in Arthur Andersen, the
Government contended that “[m]ost federal prosecutors will henceforth use Section 1519—which does not require proof that the defendant engaged in ‘corrupt persua[sion]’—to
prosecute document destruction cases.” Brief for the United States in Opposition, Arthur Andersen, LLP v. United States, 544 U.S. 596, 125 S. Ct. 2129 (2005) (No. 04-368), 2004 WL
2825876, at *13. Accordingly, the risk of criminal liability for improper document retention and destruction practices remains a real threat even after the Arthur Andersen decision.
26
  A significant set of obligations (and consequences) arises from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Act”). Though much of the Act is limited to the accounting profession, a number
of the provisions could theoretically be applied to anyone altering or destroying relevant electronic data. The general provisions of the Act are as follows:




                                                                                                                                                                                         6
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                                                                                November 2007

             7. Enormous Challenges and Reasonable Expectations: the Road Ahead
We submit the following conclusions can be reasonably drawn from the foregoing:
       •     Organizations should consider implementing information and records management policies and practices that
             specifically address electronic information and records, including the retention, preservation and destruction
             of electronic information and records.
       •     Solutions for managing electronic information and records must be flexible, reasonable and scalable to the
             enterprise (i.e., able to adjust from small to large organizations) and its circumstances. Importantly, what is
             seen as reasonable must be proportionate to the organization and its purpose.

Footnote 26 cont.

    • Section 802 of the Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1519, makes it illegal for any person to knowingly alter or destroy records with the intent to “impede, obstruct or influence the
      investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States” or in any bankruptcy case. Violation of this section
      is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and is also punishable by fines.

   • Section 802 of the Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1520(b), makes it illegal for any individual to violate any rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
     Commission (“SEC”) under 18 U.S.C. § 1520(a)(2) concerning the retention of “relevant records such as workpapers, documents that form the basis of an audit or
     review, memoranda, correspondence, communications, other documents, and records (including electronic records) which are created, sent, or received in connection
     with an audit or review and contain conclusions, opinions, analyses, or financial data relating to such an audit or review.” Of note, the record-keeping provisions of
     the act apply to domestic companies and corporations, regardless of size.

   • Section 1102 of the Act amends 18 U.S.C. § 1512 to create criminal penalties against anyone who “corruptly (1) alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record,
     document, or other object, or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object’s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding; or (2) otherwise
     obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so.” Violation of this section carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison and a fine.

   • Section 802 of the Act, at 18 U.S.C. § 1520(c), provides that nothing in 18 U.S.C. § 1520 “shall be deemed to diminish or relieve any person of any other duty or
     obligation imposed by Federal or State law or regulation to maintain, or refrain from destroying, any document.”

The SEC has made clear that the governance reforms of the Act make it “necessary for companies to ensure that their internal communications and other procedures operate so that
important information flows to the appropriate collection and disclosure points in a timely manner.” Certification of Disclosure in Companies’ Quarterly & Annual Reports, Securities
Act Release No. 33-8124, Exchange Act Release No. 34-46427, Investment Company Act Release No. 25,722, 67 Fed. Reg. 57,276, at 57,280-81 (Sept. 9, 2002) (to be codified at
17 C.F.R. pts. 228, 229, 232, 240, 249, 270 & 274). Cf. In re Tyco Int’l Ltd. Sec. Litig., No. 00 MD 1335, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11659 (D.N.H. July 27, 2000) (no special
preservation order is required to put defendants on notice regarding their obligation to preserve relevant electronic data and other materials, since such an order would unnecessarily
duplicate or improperly alter defendants’ statutory duty to preserve relevant evidence under the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4).

Finally, the Act imposes sanctions on any person who deletes or destroys relevant information required to be preserved. On one hand, this provides additional incentives for individual
employees to comply with corporate retention policies and non-destruct notices. On the other hand, the Act also provides a valuable tool for prosecutors seeking to build cases against
senior executives by plea-bargaining with low-level employees who may effectuate orders to delete data.

The SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) held public meetings in 2005 and 2006 to solicit feedback on companies’ experiences in complying with the
Act. See “PCAOB Documents” available at http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/soxcomp.htm (visited August 21, 2008). Complaints about the high costs of compliance, particularly for
smaller organizations, resulted in various proposals to reform the internal financial controls section of the Act. A proposal to amend the Act to make compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley’s
Section 404 optional for companies with total market value of less than $70 million was rejected by the Senate in April 2007. However, additional reform proposals are still under
consideration. See, e.g., H.R. 1508 (introduced March 13, 2007) and S. 869 (introduced March 14, 2007) (“A bill to reform certain provisions of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, to make compliance with that section more efficient, with the goal of maintaining United States capital market global competitiveness.”).

      •   Pragmatism must guide the scope, content, costs and anticipated results of any policy or technology solution.
          Even though we can create and store far more than we ever imagined possible in the past, the ability to
          quickly create, infinitely store and potentially retrieve does not justify legal rules or arguments requiring
          parties to save, retrieve and produce all that is technically possible through eternity.
      •   Regulatory and judicial bodies must recognize that this area is enormously complex, that the boundaries of
          legitimate policies adopted in good faith must be sufficiently elastic, and that an organization that makes good
          faith efforts in this area should not be penalized for partial performance or an imperfect implementation. The
          failure to store or retrieve everything (or even smaller subsets) for all time should not be perceived as hiding or
          destroying evidence. Indeed, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are predicated on substantial limits on
          discovery that are in place to secure the “just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.”23 Fed.
          R. Civ. P. 1; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2) (providing courts with discretion to manage case for efficient and
          appropriately tailored discovery).
We respectfully offer the following guidelines, commentary and illustrations to assist organizations in creating
reasonable, effective and defensible policies for managing information and records in the electronic age.


The Sedona Guidelines for Managing Information and Records In The Electronic Age

1. An organization should have reasonable policies and procedures for managing its information and records.

     a.   Information and records management is important in the electronic age.
     b.   The hallmark of an organization’s information and records management policies should be reasonableness.
     c.   Defensible policies need not mandate the retention of all information and documents.

2.        An organization’s information and records management policies and procedures should be realistic,
          practical and tailored to the circumstances of the organization.

     a.   No single standard or model can fully meet an organization’s unique needs.
     b.   Information and records management requires practical, flexible and scalable solutions that address the
          differences in an organization’s business needs, operations, IT infrastructure and regulatory and legal
          responsibilities.
     c.   An organization must assess its legal requirements for retention and destruction in developing an information
          and records management policy.
     d.   An organization should assess the operational and strategic value of its information and records in developing
          an information and records management program.
     e.   A business continuation or disaster recovery plan has different purposes from those of an information and
          records management program.
3.        An organization need not retain all electronic information ever generated or received.

     a.   Destruction is an acceptable stage in the information life cycle; an organization may destroy or delete
          electronic information when there is no continuing value or need to retain it.
     b.   Systematic deletion of electronic information is not synonymous with evidence spoliation.
     c.   Absent a legal requirement to the contrary, organizations may adopt programs that routinely delete certain
          recorded communications, such as electronic mail, instant messaging, text messaging and voice-mail.
     d.   Absent a legal requirement to the contrary, organizations may recycle or destroy hardware or media that
          contain data retained for business continuation or disaster recovery purposes.

     e.   Absent a legal requirement to the contrary, organizations may systematically delete or destroy residual,
          shadowed or deleted data.
     f.   Absent a legal requirement to the contrary, organizations are not required to retain metadata, however they
          may wish to do so in some instances.

4.        An organization adopting an information and records management policy should also develop procedures
          that address the creation, identification, retention, retrieval and ultimate disposition or destruction of
          information and records.

     a.   Information and records management policies must be put into practice.
     b.   Information and records management policies and practices should be documented.
     c.   An organization should define roles and responsibilities for program direction and administration within its
          information and records management policies.\
     d.   An organization should guide employees regarding how to identify and maintain information that has a
          business purpose or is required to be maintained by law or regulation.
     e.   An organization may choose to define separately the roles and responsibilities of content and technology
          custodians for electronic records management.
     f.   An organization should consider the impact of technology (including potential benefits) on the creation,
          retention and destruction of information and records.
     g.   An organization should recognize the importance of employee education concerning its information and
          records management program, policies and procedures.
     h.   An organization should consider conducting periodic compliance reviews of its information and records
          management policies and procedures, and responding to the findings of those reviews as appropriate.
     i.   Policies and procedures regarding electronic management and retention should be coordinated and/or
          integrated with the organization’s policies regarding the use of property and information, including applicable
          privacy rights or obligations.
     j.   Policies and procedures should be revised as necessary in response to changes in workforce or organizational
          structure, business practices, legal or regulatory requirements and technology.

5.        An organization’s policies and procedures must mandate the suspension of ordinary destruction practices
          and procedures as necessary to comply with preservation obligations related to actual or reasonably
          anticipated litigation, government investigation or audit.

     a.   An organization must recognize that suspending the normal disposition of electronic information and records
          may be necessary in certain circumstances.
     b.   An organization’s information and records management program should anticipate circumstances that will
          trigger the suspension of normal destruction procedures.
     c.   An organization should identify persons with authority to suspend normal destruction procedures and impose
          a legal hold.
     d.   An organization’s information and records management procedures should recognize and may describe the
          process for suspending normal records and information destruction and identify the individuals responsible
          for implementing a legal hold.
     e.   Legal holds and procedures should be appropriately tailored to the circumstances.

  f.    Effectively communicating notice of a legal hold should be an essential component of an organization’s
        information and records management program.
  g.    Documenting the steps taken to implement a legal hold may be beneficial.
  h.    If an organization takes reasonable steps to implement a legal hold, it should not be held responsible for the
        acts of an individual acting outside the scope of authority and/or in a manner inconsistent with the legal hold
        notice.
  i.    Legal holds are exceptions to ordinary retention practices and when the exigency underlying the hold no
        longer exists (i.e., there is no continuing duty to preserve the information), organizations are free to lift the
        legal hold.

                                                        Guidelines & Comments
1.      An organization should have reasonable policies and procedures for managing its information and records.

        Comment 1.a.
        Information and records management is important in the electronic age.

The fundamental transition to an electronic data environment in most organizations has resulted in an increased need
for better information and records management controls and programs. Furthermore, pressures from regulators,
investors and the legal sector placing a greater emphasis on good corporate governance practices have exacerbated the
need for the development of effective policies and procedures. For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act includes
information retention requirements for auditors (15 U.S.C.A. § 7213(a)(2)(A)(i) (Thomson West Supp. 2005)),
imperatives that corporate officers certify financial statements (15 U.S.C.A. § 7241 (Thomson West Supp. 2005)), and
amendments to criminal statutes on obstruction of justice for failure to preserve information relevant to government
“matter[s]” (18 U.S.C.A. § 1519 (Thomson West Supp. 2005)). Several institutions have had multi-million dollar
penalties imposed for failing to maintain or produce information as required by regulators. High visibility trials
involving alleged corporate fraud or document destruction have occurred, resulting in several convictions,
imprisonments and substantial monetary penalties. Still other companies have faced stiff fines and damage to their
reputation when consumer records laden with sensitive private information have been breached or inexplicably “lost,”
triggering costly notification and (in some states) credit monitoring services under state security breach laws.

As a result of these several converging forces, top management in many organizations is increasingly aware that
identifying and managing information and records should be a business priority. Indeed, in many organizations the
subject is now recognized as a “C-level” issue—one of concern to chief executive, chief financial, chief legal, chief
compliance and chief information or technology officers. In other organizations, creating such awareness may require
a significant shift in the organization’s mindset, something that often occurs when an organization has its own “life-
altering event.”

Elevating records management to the level of asset management and including electronic information and records
assets in the matrix are first steps in promoting the program and increasing its visibility. Organizations should
recognize that effectively implementing an information and records management program may require significant
financial and human resources. Focusing attention and resources on information as an organizational asset, and
having clear rules for retention and storage, however, can produce substantial benefits. Among these potential benefits
are: quicker and more reliable retrieval to assist decision-making and compliance with regulatory requests or
Sarbanes-Oxley requirements; reduction of administrative time spent searching for information among cluttered
systems; reduced total operating costs; minimized risk from litigation or administrative penalties; and better
preservation of institutional memory. Indeed, some organizations have created the position of chief records officer
(another C-level position) in recognition of these objectives to those organizations.

In short, managing electronic and other information is not merely a clerical matter. Nor, even with currently available
tools, is it something that can be mastered through technology alone. Instead, it is a core component of resource
management to be nurtured and enhanced. As such, managing electronic and other information depends on an
intelligent blend of people, processes and technology. The organizations that best manage and leverage information
assets are likely to thrive in their respective disciplines, and success in this area demands a priority commitment from
senior management to develop and support effective processes.

Organizations are also well served by examining and inventorying their various sources and locations of electronic
documents and information in light of the 2006 amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil procedure relating to
electronically stored information (“ESI”). Organizations need to have sufficient knowledge about their information
systems to impose an appropriate legal hold and meet their obligations to preserve, disclose, collect and produce
potentially relevant ESI. Outside counsel may be well advised to encourage reliable inventories. In one case the court
found monetary sanctions appropriate when counsel relied solely on the client’s statements about the location of

                                                                                                                      11
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                      November 2007

relevant data, finding counsel failed to conduct an adequate investigation and had a duty to inquire about sources of
information. See Phoenix Four v. Strategic Res. Corp., 2006 WL 1409413 (S.D.N.Y. May 23, 2006). An exemplar
“survey of data” containing potential inquiries for self-examination is included as Appendix C.


       Comment 1.b.
       The hallmark of an organization’s information and records management policies should be
reasonableness.

An organization’s approach to retaining information and records should be reasonable under the circumstances.
Usually the reasonableness of an approach (including any policy) will not be subject to external scrutiny, such as a
court proceeding. When such scrutiny occurs, it is often in the litigation context of explaining why specific
information and records no longer exist, i.e., how they were lost or destroyed. As noted in numerous cases, an
established and reasonable policy may be very important in establishing the good faith destruction of the information
so that no sanctions should be imposed on an organization. See Stevenson v. Union Pacific R.R., 354 F.3d 739, 747
(8th Cir. 2004) (evaluating reasonableness of destruction of corporate records before and after commencement of
litigation); Willard v. Caterpillar, Inc., 40 Cal. App. 4th 892, 921, 48 Cal. Rptr. 2d 607, 625 (Cal. Ct. App. 1995)
(“good faith disposal pursuant to a bona fide consistent and reasonable document retention policy could justify a
failure to produce document in discovery.”) (citing Carlucci v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 102 F.R.D. 427, 481-82 (S.D. Fla.
1984)); Turner v. Hudson Transit Lines, Inc., 142 F.R.D. 68, 69 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) (destruction pursuant to a document
policy evidenced negligence rather than intentional conduct, but because destruction occurred after litigation was
commenced, sanctions under the facts were warranted); Telectron, Inc. v. Overhead Door Corp., 116 F.R.D. 107, 123
(S.D. Fla. 1987) (“The absence of a coherent document retention policy during the pendency of this lawsuit” was
cited as leading to “possibly damaging document destruction occurring in both routine and non-routine manners ….”
where flagrant and willful destruction of records specifically called for in production request were destroyed.); see also
Ian C. Ballon, Spoliation of E Mail Evidence: Proposed Intranet Policies and a Framework for Analysis, CYBERSPACE
LAWYER (March 1999) p. 4 and n.19.

Furthermore, absent evidence that an organization has actual knowledge that specific information would be material to
foreseeable claims or legal requirements, its best judgment about what information to retain and for how long will
generally be respected. See Arthur Andersen, LLP v. United States, 544 U.S. 696, 125 S. Ct. 2129, 2135 (2005) (“It is,
of course, not wrongful for a manager to instruct his employees to comply with a valid document retention policy
under ordinary circumstances.”) However, as is emphasized in Guideline 5, an organization must be prepared to
accommodate the often broader demands of litigation which may require suspension of plans to delete or destroy
information under a retention schedule based on the end of the useful life of that document. The failure to make such
accommodation may call into question the reasonableness of a policy in certain circumstances. See, e.g., Broccoli v.
EchoStar Communications Corp., 229 F.R.D. 506 (D. Md. 2005).

With respect to electronic information and records, a critical issue in determining reasonableness will be the
information technology in place at the time. Unlike paper records, many aspects of the distribution and content of
electronic information are dictated by the information technology used. Technology has an important effect on any
information and records management approach. Judging reasonableness includes considering the substantial efforts
required to understand new technologies and to adopt policies governing the management of electronic information
and records. Considering what is reasonable (while balancing costs and benefits) also requires recognizing that the
implementation of improved electronic and information management programs may take a significant amount of time
and resources to implement.

When evaluating records retention policies and practices, courts routinely examine the reasonableness of the policies
and practices given the facts and circumstances surrounding the information or record at issue. See Lewy v. Remington
Arms Co., 836 F.2d 1104, 1112 (8th Cir. 1988) (noting that retaining appointment books for three years might be
reasonable, while retaining customer complaints about product safety for three years might not be reasonable); see also



                                                                                                                        12

United States v. Taber Extrusions L.P., No. 4:00CV00255, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24600, at *8 9 (E.D. Ark. Dec. 27,
2001). In Taber Extrusions, the government had destroyed documents related to government contracts under its
document retention policy. In analyzing the reasonableness of the destruction of those documents under Lewy, the
court first found that the policy of destroying the documents after six years and three months appeared reasonable on
its face. The court then found there was no evidence that the government should have known that the documents
would become material. Taber Extrusions, at *9; see also Bass-Davis v. Davis, 134 P.3d 103, 110 (Nev. 2006) (“[W]illful
suppression or destruction . . . requires more than simple destruction of evidence and instead requires that evidence be
destroyed with the intent to harm another party.”), overruling in part Reingold v. Wet ‘N Wild Nev., Inc. 944 P.2d 800,
802 (Nev. 1997) (adverse inference instruction appropriate where party’s document retention policy resulted in
destruction of documents prior to expiration of statute of limitations on potential claims).



               Comment 1.c.
               Defensible policies need not mandate the retention of all information and documents.

There is no general requirement that organizations must retain all information created or received in the ordinary
course of business, and statutory and regulatory obligations usually specify records retention requirements based on
content. Indeed, in the ordinary course of business, it is expected that organizations will delete or destroy information
by choice or necessity. See Arthur Andersen, LLP v. United States, 544 U.S. 696, 125 S. Ct. 2129, 2135 (2005)
(“‘Document retention policies,’ which are created in part to keep certain information from getting into the hands of
others, including the Government, are common in business.”); Hynix Semiconductor Inc. v. Rambus, Inc., 2006 WL
565893 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 5, 2006) (adoption of a “content-neutral” document retention and destruction policy is a
“permissible business decision”)27 ; Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (“FACTA”), and regulations
promulgated thereunder, notably 16 C.F.R. § 682.2(a) (requiring the destruction of certain consumer information in
the interest of reducing “the risk of consumer fraud and related harms, including identity theft, created by improper
disposal of consumer information.”). Even in the context of litigation, where preservation obligations extend to
evidence (and not just “records”) relevant to the proceedings, courts have routinely recognized that it is unrealistic for
organizations to keep everything. See, e.g., Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC, 220 F.R.D. 212, 217 (S.D.N.Y. 2003)
(“Must a corporation, upon recognizing the threat of litigation, preserve every shred of paper, every e mail or electronic
document, and every backup tape? The answer is clearly, ‘no.’ Such a rule would cripple large corporations, like UBS,
that are almost always involved in litigation.”); see also Consol. Aluminum Corp. v. Alcoa, Inc., 2006 WL 2583308
(M.D. La. July 19, 2006) (quoting Zubulake); Durst v. FedEx Express, 2006 WL 1541027 at *5 (D. N.J. June 2, 2006)
(“A litigant ‘is under no duty to keep or retain every document in its possession ... [only] what it knows, or reasonably
should know, will likely be requested in reasonably foreseeable litigation.’”) (citing Costello v. City of Brigatine, 2001
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8687 at *75 (D.N.J.2001); Computek Computer & Office Supplies, Inc. v. Walton, 156 S.W.3d 217
(Tex. App. 2005) (finding injunction prohibiting plaintiff from removing or deleting any files in its possession
overbroad; court held that plaintiff had a legal right to delete its own records and files unrelated to the litigation);
Wiginton v. Ellis, No. 02 C 6832, 2003 WL 22439865, at *4, *7 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 27, 2003) (An organization “does not
have to preserve every single scrap of paper in its business”; “CBRE did not have the duty to preserve every single piece
of electronic data in the entire company.”); Concord Boat Corp. v. Brunswick Corp., No. LR C 95 781, 1997 WL
33352759, at *4 (E.D. Ark. Aug. 29, 1997) (“[T]o hold that a corporation is under a duty to preserve all e mail
potentially relevant to any future litigation would be tantamount to holding that the corporation must preserve all e
mail. … Such a proposition is not justified.”).

Beyond recognizing the fact that no retention matrix, schedule or practice can realistically describe in detail or capture
all data and information in an organization, there is also a need to understand that policies and procedures cannot
possibly anticipate all circumstances. In the world of rapidly evolving technology, organizations cannot be expected to
always have a policy provision or practice to address all of the applied technology and communications channels. Yet
organizations should recognize that static or inflexible policies and procedures run the risk of becoming outdated,
unreasonable and ineffective.

2.         An organization’s information and records management policies and procedures should be realistic,
           practical and tailored to the circumstances of the organization.

           Comment 2.a.
           No single standard or model can fully meet an organization’s unique needs.

For better or worse, the extraordinary flexibility of computer network configurations directly affects the information
and records management analysis. There is no single best answer for all organizations, and the course an organization
takes will often depend upon its own unique information technology architecture as well as its relative dependence on
technology in its business.

The development of a reasonable approach for managing electronic information and records must rest on a full
understanding of how individual business users actually use the information they need in their work. The approach to
managing information and records must take variances between departments, business units and other groups into
account—ideally working around the differences and tailoring solutions that best advance the organization’s corporate
mission while meeting basic legal responsibilities.

Factors to consider include:

           •    The nature of the business

           •    The legal and regulatory environment surrounding the organization and particular sub-units;

           •    The culture of the organization;

           •    The distributed or centralized nature of data within the organization; and

           •    The business practices and procedures that have evolved independently of any information or record
                management approach.

There are many ways that an organization can meet its goals and responsibilities in managing information and records.
Some could create a centralized function for compliance. Others may invest in substantial education programs and
then delegate significant responsibilities to individual employees. Others may look to automated technology solutions
for records management that search content and metadata to identify, maintain and dispose of records according to
pre-defined retention periods. There is no way to judge one right and one wrong approach in the abstract—the “best
practice” for any one organization could be an impractical and unwise approach for another. Indeed, this variability
itself makes it difficult for the organization to benchmark its own practices against others to gauge success, although
some baseline comparisons can be drawn.

Critically, outsiders who one day may have to evaluate a policy or approach (whether courts, auditors, investigators or
others) must recognize the fundamental reality of such variability.

           Comment 2.b.
           Information and records management requires practical, flexible and scalable solutions that address the
           differences in an organization’s business needs, operations, IT infrastructure and regulatory and legal
           responsibilities.


An information and records management program must reflect the actual use of information within an organization.
It should not reflect an unrealistic view of either how the Legal Department “would like things to be” or how the
Information Technology Department would prefer to organize the company’s information for system performance or
software architecture reasons, notwithstanding practical issues. Although both perspectives are important components
of the ultimate design, an information and records management program with idealized or unrealistic standards (i.e.,
ones not reasonably tailored to the organization’s actual needs and usage) probably will not be appropriate for the




                                                                                                                     14
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                                                                                      November 2007

organization’s culture and will not be effective. At the same time, the records management perspective cannot dictate
results that are technically or economically infeasible, or legally impermissible or unsound.

In short, the information and records management policy should recognize and be consistent with an organization’s
culture, actual experience and needs, as well as pre-existing structures and policies. Ivory tower drafting of a policy
that states what the organization “should” do (but perhaps cannot do or never has previously done) may be worse than
no policy at all.

Decisions about what electronic information should be retained and how it should be handled involve many cutting
edge technological issues and conflicting policy interests. Ideally, an organization’s approach to information and
records management should be discussed and developed with input from legal counsel, information technology
representatives, records management representatives, and representatives from the business functions of the
organization to which it will apply. One possibility for larger organizations is an oversight committee composed of
representatives from the functions named. In some organizations, this list may be expanded to include internal audit,
human resources and other groups. In smaller companies, the responsibilities may be delegated to a very small group
or even an individual. In any event, support from senior management is also important. See United States ex rel. Koch
v. Koch Indus., 197 F.R.D. 488, 490-91 (N.D. Okla. 1999); In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. Sales Practices Litig.,
169 F.R.D. 598, 615 (D.N.J. 1997)

There is no “one size fits all” for information and records management. In some organizations, there might be a single
document on the subject. In others, the organization may have a master policy with separate procedures or processes
developed and implemented by departments or regions. In some cases, an organization may focus on amending an
existing policy and delegating responsibility to a traditional records management department. In another, individual
units may be empowered to develop and apply reasonable procedures that focus on the information needed by that
unit. See Comment 2.a. Although examples of successful models, including exemplary written policies, are available
from various sources, an organization’s approach must be tailored to its own specific needs and circumstances.
Drafters should consider what is reasonably possible, given the organization’s structure, culture and resources. The
organization should strive to demonstrate reasonable compliance with policies instituted in good faith. And, in all
cases, any approach adopted must contemplate the unique needs triggered by litigation. See Guideline 5.

The factors in formulating information and records management policies and procedures are numerous and complex.
Among the variables to be considered, which are discussed in these Guidelines, are:

                      •       The scope and structure of the policy (e.g., whether a uniform approach is adopted worldwide,
                              regionally, etc., and whether it applies to the organization and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, etc.);28

                      •       Roles and responsibilities for creating, implementing and revising the policy.
                              See Comments 4.b and 4.d;

                      •       The types and forms of information or records that should be retained to meet operational and legal
                              needs, including a recognition that computers produce information that must be managed in
                              accordance with the policy. See Comments 2.c and 2.d;

                      •       How the organization will document its records retention, destruction and security requirements (e.g.,
                              through published retention schedules or through means embedded within software applications or in
                              business procedures or some combination thereof );

     It should be noted that the less variation in a policy between departments and locations, the easier (and less expensive) it will be to train and enforce the policy across the organization.

                disposition;
          •     Methods for monitoring and assessing compliance with the policy. See Comment 4.h;
          •     The costs and burdens that may be imposed by various approaches and policies; and
          •     Procedures for suspending normal destruction, as appropriate, because of actual or reasonably anticipated
                litigation, an investigation or audit, i.e., instituting a “legal hold” on the information and records. See
                Guideline 5.
Perfection should never be allowed to become the enemy of good. No policy can be drafted that will be truly
omnibus—there is simply too much information in too many places to cover every possible variation of facts and
circumstances. Good faith efforts to develop and implement a reasonable policy should be viewed as sufficient for
most purposes.


                Comment 2.c.
                An organization must assess its legal requirements for retention and destruction in developing an
                information and records management policy.

From a records management perspective, appropriately managed information is retained only so long as it has value to
an organization or is required by law or regulation to be retained. Typically, these retention periods are reflected in an
organization’s records retention schedule. Reliance on the schedule pre-supposes that the appropriate decisions have
been made concerning the length of time something has value and whether its retention is subject to a legal or
regulatory obligation.29
 The true measure of a good records and information management policy is whether it allows the organization to meet
its legal and regulatory obligations, and meet whatever internal goals the organization has set for the policy (e.g.,
reduce the cost of storage by reducing the amount of information that is stored; reduce the time involved in retrieving
valuable information; protect information that supports intellectual property rights). However, these are generally
intangible matters and it is usually in the context of litigation (or government investigation such as the Arthur Andersen
case) that such programs are judged.
A critical step in developing an information and records management policy is identifying the applicable legal
requirements concerning the retention and destruction of information. An organization must consider the externally
mandated laws and regulations that govern it (e.g., IRS, SEC, DOD, Department of Labor/EEOC, EPA, FTC, state
and federal privacy laws and regulations, etc.), as well as its duties to preserve data relevant to actual or reasonably
anticipated litigation. See, e.g., Rambus, Inc. v. Infineon Techs. AG, 220 F.R.D. 264, 281 (E.D. Va. 2004), subsequent
determination, 222 F.R.D. 280 (E.D. Va. 2004)30 ; Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC, 220 F.R.D. 212, 216 (S.D.N.Y.
2003).
The organization’s research likely will result in a matrix of retention obligations similar to those that were typical in
traditional hard copy retention policies. Traditionally, the matrix of time periods and classifications was documented
in a records retention schedule.31 Today, in light of the tremendous volumes of information being generated and
received and the decentralized management of the content of electronically stored information (i.e., individual users
are often the content owners), it is becoming increasingly important for organizations to consider consolidating their



_________________

  Importantly, it is the schedule which should control retention, rather than an independent (“in-the-moment”) decision by each employee as to value. While an individual employee
may be required to determine whether a specific piece of information (e.g. an e-mail, a hard copy memorandum or letter, or an instant message) fits within a records type, he or she is not
determining the inherent value of the information and how long it should be kept based on that assessment.
30
     See further discussion of the Rambus litigations, including a court which reached the opposite conclusion, below.
31
  Many organizations already have such retention schedules for their paper records. Often, however, the schedules have not been updated and are not specifically tailored to address or
incorporate electronic records, even despite incorporation of language in the organization’s policies purporting to cover electronic records.



                                                                                                                                                                                          16
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                                                                                November 2007

retention schedules. Thus, some organizations are turning to “bucketed” approaches that dramatically limit the
number of mandatory classifications that must be made by individuals, while ensuring that the minimum retention
periods for information are met.
Regardless of nomenclature, an organization’s overall strategic thinking about managing information should be the
same for electronic records as for paper records, as it is the content rather than the format that matters (i.e., the
retention schedule is generally media neutral).32 Importantly, with the enactment of legislation (such as
Sarbanes-Oxley) and adoption of regulations (such as those implementing the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions
Act of 2003 “FACTA”), organizations must consider processes to review periodically and update policies, procedures
and programs to meet changing legal requirements. See, e.g., FTC Fair Credit Reporting Act Rule, 16 C.F.R. § 682.3
(implementing § 216 of FACTA and requiring proper disposal of consumer information so as to protect against
unauthorized access).
Beyond the strict legal requirements,33 a reasonable policy can serve the legitimate information storage, access, security
and retention needs of the organization.34 An information and records management policy should identify and
prescribe time periods for the retention of information and records that are appropriate to an organization’s needs and
legal responsibilities. Such a policy serves a legitimate business purpose and is not designed to eliminate potential
“smoking guns.” See Lewy v. Remington Arms Co., 836 F.2d 1104, 1112 (8th Cir. 1988) (part three of three-part test
to evaluate the reasonableness of defendant’s document retention policy is whether policy was instituted in bad faith).35
An organization focusing on eliminating “bad” documents not only risks accusations of bad faith (or worse) but also
fails to recognize the value of contextual documents to mitigate the so-called “bad” documents and potentially
exonerate the organization from allegations of misconduct or wrongdoing.
             Illustration i. Beta Company recently went through a merger in which the FTC required that
             volumes of documents, including electronic documents, be produced for antitrust review. Beta
             devoted substantial resources both inside and outside the company to retrieving the documents,
             reviewing them for relevance and copying them for the FTC. In the process, Beta concluded that
             many documents it reviewed served no continuing business purpose and were not responsive to the
             government’s inquiries. It cost an additional $100,000 to review these documents. Beta has since
             determined that it needs a records management and retention program (with appropriate legal holds
             provisions) to maintain and access records for business purposes and to dispose of the records after
             their useful life is over. Beta’s policy will likely be viewed as legitimate because it can demonstrate that
             business purposes were advanced by implementing the policy (and, indeed, drove its evolution).
The consequences for ill-conceived document management policies that merely serve as vehicles to “cleanse” files in
advance of anticipated litigation or investigation can be severe. Indeed, a focus on concealment and damage control,
as opposed to targeted retention based on operational, legal or institutional value, may even result in criminal
penalties. Sections 802 and 1102 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 provide for fines and/or up to 20 years’
imprisonment for destroying or concealing documents or other evidence with the intent to impair their availability for
use in a proceeding or with the intent to impede, obstruct or influence federal investigations or bankruptcy
proceedings.

  There are a number of “off the shelf ” software packages that, combined with regular updates, can provide a cost effective way to identify retention statutes and regulations, provided
there is a way to apply changes to the manner by which the organization manages its information and records.
33
  Some organizations separately schedule those documents subject to identified legal retention requirements, from those documents that are kept for business needs. Other organizations
combine the categories.

34
   Reasonableness standards for traditional records management programs were previously established by Carlucci v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 102 F.R.D. 472 (S.D. Fla. 1984), and Lewy v.
Remington Arms Co., 836 F.2d 1104 (8th Cir. 1988), and still serve as the basis for assessing good faith efforts. At the same time, organizations need to recognize that, as technology
changes, information and records management policies may need to be revisited and evolve as necessary to remain reasonable under the circumstances.

35
  The mere existence of a written policy will not establish that document destruction was justified. Without a sound monitoring and compliance program, a records management policy
may be criticized as eliminating only “bad documents.” See Carlucci v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 102 F.R.D. 472, 485-86 (S.D. Fla. 1984) (finding failure to implement the document
retention policy in a consistent manner to be a significant factor in finding that the destruction of certain evidence relevant to legal proceedings could not be explained or excused as
compliance with the policy).


                                                                                                                                                                                            17
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                     November 2007

In civil litigation, records management programs that focus on eliminating “bad documents” may be criticized as
illegitimate “document destruction” policies that may result in severe sanctions, including default judgment. For
example, in Rambus, Inc. v. Infineon Techs. AG, 220 F.R.D. 264, 286 (E.D. Va. 2004), subsequent determination,
222 F.R.D. 280 (E.D. Va. 2004), the plaintiff was internally discussing patent infringement litigation at the same time
as it was preparing a document retention strategy that included a “Shred Day” shortly before the lawsuit was filed
during which approximately 20,000 pounds of documents and approximately two million pages were destroyed. The
court ordered discovery of the lawyer’s files concerning the document retention program under the crime-fraud
exception to the attorney-client privilege. Rambus v. Infineon was tried to the court in February 2005. At the close of
the evidence, the court found by clear and convincing evidence that the plaintiff had “unclean hands” due to its
spoliation of evidence, barring it from enforcing the patents in suit and that dismissal was appropriate. Before the
court could issue findings and conclusions, the parties settled the case.
The question of whether Rambus implemented and followed in good faith a reasonable records retention policy
and/or reasonably anticipated litigation when it destroyed documents pursuant to that policy has been the subject of
numerous other actions. In Hynix Semiconductor, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc., 2006 WL 565893 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 5, 2006), the
Northern District of California reached the opposite conclusion reached by the court in the Eastern District of
Virginia. Holding that because the path to the initiation of litigation was neither “clear nor immediate” and because
numerous conditions needed to be met first, the court found it could not conclude that Rambus anticipated litigation
and that the evidence did not support the conclusion that Rambus intentionally designed its document retention
policy to get rid of damaging documents. Id. at *21-*25. However, the Eastern District of Virginia was not swayed
from its position when in July 2006 it issued another opinion finding that Rambus had engaged in spoliation of
evidence, but refusing to award attorneys’ fees to Samsung because it did not prove that the attorneys’ fees sought were
related to the misconduct. See Samsung Electronics Co., LTD v. Rambus, Inc., 2006 WL 2038417 (July 18, 2006
E.D.Va.)
Finally, while the FTC held that it did not need to resolve whether Rambus engaged in spoliation because it had
already found Rambus guilty on the merits, it stressed that:
        Rambus’ extensive document destruction campaign had the potential to deny the
        Commission an opportunity to examine thoroughly Rambus’ conduct. In some instances,
        the Commission relied on evidence that was preserved only fortuitously. If the record in this
        case had been marginal, while simultaneously containing evidence that Rambus destroyed
        potentially relevant documents, we would have pursued the spoliation inquiry to its
        conclusion and, if appropriate, imposed a remedy.
See Opinion of the Commission, In the Matter of Rambus, Inc., Docket No. 9302 (August 2, 2006). See also Kozlowski v.
Sears, Roebuck & Co., 73 F.R.D. 73, 76 (D. Mass. 1976) (a party cannot excuse itself from compliance with discovery
rules by adopting a records management system designed to make discovery unduly difficult). Compare Arthur
Andersen, LLP v. United States, 544 U.S. 696, 125 S. Ct. 2129, 2135 (2005) (“‘Document retention policies,’ which
are created in part to keep certain information from getting into the hands of others, including the Government, are
common in business.”), rev’g, 374 F.3d 281 (5th Cir. 2004) (affirming jury verdict finding accounting firm guilty of
obstructing an official proceeding of the Securities and Exchange Commission, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b)(2)
; Bass-Davis v. Davis, 134 P.3d 103, 110 (Nev. 2006). (evidence destroyed as part of a document retention policy
before any notice of an obligation to retain that evidence is not willful suppression, absent any evidence that the
destruction was done to harm another party), overruling in part Reingold v. Wet ‘N Wild Nev., Inc. 944 P.2d 800, 802
(Nev. 1997) (holding a one-season retention policy at a water park was unreasonable as “deliberately designed to
prevent production of records in any subsequent litigation”).
        Illustration ii. Acme Corporation’s stock prices have been dropping and current management
        suspects that in its last securities offering some corners may have been cut. It reasonably anticipates
        that it may be named in a class action securities lawsuit or investigated for securities fraud in the
        foreseeable future. It implements a records management policy focused on destroying, among other
        things, high level e-mail communications that will probably be the focus of discovery in the
        investigation. Acme’s policy may be viewed with a high level of scrutiny and be considered geared
        toward destruction of evidence, potentially subjecting it to spoliation claims and possible criminal
        sanctions.

For organizations with international operations or data, determining applicable legal requirements is even more
complicated. For example, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2000/C364/01) recognizes
that each person has a right to the protection of personal data and that such data must be processed fairly, for specified
purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person or some other legitimate lawful basis. Charter of Fundamental
Rights of the European Union, art. 8, 2000 O.J. (C 364) 1, 10 (Dec. 18, 2000), available at
http://www.europarl.eu.int/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf. This right includes the fundamental right to access personal data
and to correct any mistakes in that data. The legislation protecting individuals’ rights in relation to personal data is
mostly contained within Directive 95/46/EC on Data Protection (the “Directive”), which seeks to harmonize the
applicable national legislation for each member state. Council Direct 95/46 on the Protection of Individuals With
Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of Such Data, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31 (Nov. 23, 1995).
In the People’s Republic of China, on the other hand, there is limited regulation on document retention in place, but
it is generally understood that the civil law principle protecting the right to privacy also applies in relation to the
protection of personal data. See also Comment 4.h.

             Comment 2.d.
             An organization should assess the operational and strategic value of its information and records in
             developing an information and records management program.

Information and records can be valuable strategic assets. Indeed, organizations invest substantial capital in generating
and storing electronic information representing a wealth of institutional knowledge. The value of these assets often
depends on the accessibility of the information. An effective program should reflect the value of an organization’s
information and records.
An organization’s information and records management program will necessarily reflect judgments on how best to
capture and manage records, including electronic records, which have lasting value to the organization.36 Cf. Pub.
Citizen v. Carlin, 184 F.3d 900, 909-10 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (finding it appropriate under federal statute to allow
agencies to maintain record-keeping systems in the form most appropriate to the business of the agency, reflecting its
administrative, legal, research and other values, and without regard to the prospective interests of future researchers).
             Illustration iii. A large pharmaceutical manufacturer has developed several promising new leads on
             anti-viral drugs, but has suffered significant turnover in its lead researchers. Because the company’s
             information and records management program specifies that all records relating to research projects
             should be kept for six years past the time a product resulting from the research is brought to market
             or three years after the research is officially terminated, the company’s newest researcher is able to
             review the work of her predecessors and determine what areas deserve greater study without the
             amount of trial and error that might otherwise be necessary.
             Illustration iv. PatentCo is involved in a dispute concerning the validity of certain patents it owns,
             alleging that they are being infringed by several of its competitors. In developing its processes,
             PatentCo’s scientists kept electronic laboratory notebooks detailing each step of their research and
             their discovery of the process that resulted in the patented invention. PatentCo’s records management
             policy and retention schedule require that laboratory notebooks be kept permanently so that it can
             recreate the inventive process if necessary. When patent litigation occurs later, PatentCo is able to
             show that it filed its patent application less than one year from the date of its scientist’s discovery of a
             successful process, avoiding a claim that its patent is invalid.

  Appendix C to this document provides a sample assessment tool that can be used as a starting point by organizations addressing records management issues, with particular emphasis on
electronic information. Of course, this form is generic and will need to be tailored to fit particular circumstances.




                                                                                                                                                                                   19
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                                                                               November 2007

The value of information will vary greatly from organization to organization, and even within an organization. How
an organization chooses to capture this value may also vary accordingly. One organization may choose to concentrate
its resources on capturing the value in its research or product development records while another may emphasize its
sales or marketing resources. The solutions, policies, practices and training employed, as well as the technological
resources invested, will reflect internal business judgments as to the best approach for that entity. This makes it
impossible to develop a “generic” information and records management policy appropriate for every organization. See
Comment 2.a. Organizations should make a conscious effort to recognize and make accessible the information
necessary to meet the organization’s needs and responsibilities. Conversely, information not of value may and should
be discarded, see Guideline 3, subject, of course, to the need to preserve discoverable information needed for litigation
purposes. See Guideline 5.
In addition, organizations should understand that proper information and records management is a process and not a
project. Organizations continue to evolve, as do their products and services. Accordingly, in the same way that
continued vigilance regarding changes in the regulatory environment is necessary, ongoing diligence regarding business
structure and conditions, as well as computer hardware and software, is critical to the long-term success of any
information and records management program. See Comment 4.i.

                Comment 2.e.
                A business continuation or disaster recovery plan has different purposes from those of an information and
                records management program.

Business continuation or disaster recovery plans and programs, such as those employing backup systems, allow an
organization to rebuild its electronic information systems and to continue operations despite a significant network
failure.37 What must be stored in order to achieve this goal and the manner and length of storage time will generally be
decided by an organization’s information technology professionals (with substantive input from the other disciplines—
operational, records management and legal) as the individuals who will be relied on to manage the recovery.
Consideration should typically be given to making the storage time period as short as possible—only that amount of
time that is truly necessary to recover from a disaster.
There is general consensus that regardless of the various capabilities of different backup systems, those systems are
designed for the purpose of business continuity and should not be used as a substitute for records management. While
the backup systems can provide the capability to recover data when necessary, those capabilities are fundamentally
different from what is required for information and records management. Moreover, after a relatively short period of
time, it is simply impractical for backup systems to retrieve efficiently or effectively specific, targeted information.
Reflecting this reality, the amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure adopt a general rule that information
stored on traditional backup tapes would not be part of a party’s first-wave document production obligations, but
could be the subject of discovery in a proper case where good cause is shown. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 (as amended
December 1, 2006)38 . Accordingly, it would be useful and reasonable to reflect this in the policies, procedures and
programs by separately providing for disaster recovery systems and procedures applying to electronic information and
records management.

The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                                                                                  November 2007

The policy for disaster recovery for electronic information should describe:
                •            What constitutes a “disaster” requiring information restoration;
                •            What must be retrieved when there is a “disaster;”39
                •            What will be stored for access in the event of a “disaster;”
                •            Who has responsibility for duplicating and managing electronic information;
                •            Where and how it will be stored;
                •            How often on-line (active or archived) electronic information will be duplicated to ensure retrieval
                             and system recovery; and
                •            How long duplicate copies of electronic information must be kept before they are destroyed (through
                             deletion or otherwise).
If disaster recovery storage devices and procedures are separate from the organization’s systems for normally managing
electronic information and records, then cycles for re-use of disaster recovery backup media should be relatively short,
resulting in significant cost savings. Cf. Comment 5.e. Retention of disaster recovery backup media beyond the
period necessary to recover from a true disaster can have unintended consequences should the organization become
involved in litigation. In Coleman (Parent) Holdings, Inc. v. Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc., No.
502003CA005045XXOCAI, 2005 WL 679071 (Fla Cir. Ct. Mar. 1, 2005), further opinion 2005 WL 674885 (Mar. 23,
2005), rev’d and remanded on other grounds, —-So.2d ——, 2007 WL 837221 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. Mar. 21, 2007),
Morgan Stanley’s continual locating of additional backup tapes despite certifications that all potentially relevant
information had been located and searched derailed the substance of the litigation. Concluding that defendant had
sought to thwart discovery, and had failed through “willful and gross abuse”, “grossly negligent and negligent conduct”
with respect to discovery obligations to timely locate and produce relevant information from more than 1,000 backup
tapes, the court reversed the burden of proof and instructed the jury that Morgan Stanley had to prove that it did not
defraud the plaintiff. The jury returned verdicts of $605 million in compensatory damages and $850 million in
punitive damages.40
                Illustration v. Acme Corporation maintains disaster recovery backup tapes in the event of a system
                failure at its headquarters. One of the Vice-Presidents of Operations routinely deletes documents and
                e-mail messages that he later determines he needs to review again. He has instructed the IT staff at
                Acme to retain disaster recovery backup tapes indefinitely so they can find any documents he loses in
                the future, having read that “storage is cheap” and thinking that the cost is the incremental cost for
                additional storage tapes. Unknown to the VP, the real costs to the company are far greater. They
                include: storing the extra backup tapes in a logical manner to allow retrieval if needed, having enough
                time to mount and load disaster recovery backup tapes to locate the server and file in question, and,
                most importantly, the labor costs involved in loading the data, restoring the system and locating the
                file. Due to Acme’s recovery system configuration this process takes many hours. Thus, the cost of
                this ad hoc plan to recover a single lost document can quickly run into thousands of dollars, making
                such a program inefficient and ill-advised. Moreover, this practice may increase the risk that a court
                may determine the organization’s backup tapes are “accessible” and hence should be part of the
                organization’s initial response to routine discovery requests. See Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC,
                217 F.R.D. 309, 324 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (ordering production of e-mails stored on backup tapes).
The use of backup data for near-term recovery of deleted, corrupted or otherwise damaged files should not alter the
consideration of disaster recovery data as an inappropriate substitute for a retention program. In particular, larger
organizations today often use enterprise backup systems that maintain sophisticated database structures permitting

  In a split opinion the Florida District Court of Appeal reversed the verdict and remanded the case to the lower court with directions to enter judgment for Morgan Stanley based the
failure of the plaintiff to offer proof of its compensatory damages at trial. Because in its view this issue was dispositive of the case as to both compensatory and punitive damages, the
majority opinion did not address the e-discovery issues. The dissent, which would have affirmed the verdict on compensatory damages, but remanded the punitive damages verdict for
further proceedings, obliquely raised the issue of e-discovery. In footnote 4 the dissenting opinion states: “I agree that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in the sanctions imposed
on Morgan Stanley for substantial violations of court orders.”

specific files on the system to be identified and recovered with relative ease in the short term. This functionality can be
very important for business purposes when an employee accidentally deletes or ruins a file that embodies significant
work, or where the file becomes corrupt or damaged, or when a natural disaster (e.g., flood) destroys a system. Most
IT departments look at the ability to assist the business in this way as a key feature of a good backup system. Yet, the
ability of the system to recover files is typically limited to a very short time period because tracking the files requires a
database that soon would grow to unmanageable proportions if retention were extended. Thus, systems that address
these business continuity concerns are not substitutes for records management policies and procedures which address
different and longer retention concerns.
Having a meaningful policy and procedures for disaster recovery does not require that the related systems and
technology must be separate from other information technology solutions for the enterprise. However, any
combination must be done consciously, recognizing that the electronic information systems may be serving multiple
functions.

3.              An organization need not retain all electronic information ever generated or received.

                Comment 3.a.
                Destruction41 is an acceptable stage in the information life cycle; an organization may destroy or delete
                electronic information when there is no continuing value or need to retain it.

At the heart of a reasonable information and records management approach is the concept of the “lifecycle” of
information based on its inherent value. In essence, this means that information and records should be retained only
so long as they have value as defined by business needs or legal requirements. Thus, while some documents contain
information which is deemed irreplaceable and must be indefinitely retained, information and records that do not have
such continuing value to the organization can be destroyed or deleted when the organization, in its business judgment,
determines it is no longer needed, regardless of the form (i.e., paper or electronic). See Arthur Andersen, LLP v. United
States, 544 U.S. 696, 125 S. Ct. 2129, 2135 (2005) (“‘Document retention policies,’ which are created in part to keep
certain information from getting into the hands of others, including the Government, are common in business …. It
is, of course, not wrongful for a manager to instruct his employees to comply with a valid document retention policy
under ordinary circumstances.”). Of course, this destruction in the ordinary course is subject to suspension when
there is actual or reasonably anticipated litigation. See id.; Guideline 5 and commentary; see also The Sedona
Principles, Second Edition: Best Practices, Recommendations & Principles for Addressing Electronic Document Discovery
(The Sedona Conference® Working Group Series, 2007) (“The obligation to preserve electronic data and documents
requires reasonable and good faith efforts to retain information that may be relevant to pending or threatened
litigation. However, it is unreasonable to expect parties to take every conceivable step to preserve all potentially
relevant data.”).42

Retaining superfluous electronic information has associated direct and indirect costs and burdens that go well beyond
the cost of additional electronic storage. The direct costs include additional disk space, bandwidth, hardware,
software, archival systems and the cost of their related media migration requirements and possibly even storage area
networks to store such information. The cost of storage alone can be significant, particularly where minimum
standards exist concerning the storage media for such information.43

The indirect costs include the cost of technical staff for maintaining such information, the cost of personnel classifying
such information, and the potential cost of outside counsel to review and exclude irrelevant electronic information in
the discovery process.

There is no question that managing unneeded information increases an organization’s costs, burdens, and ability to
fashion an adequate and timely defense in litigation. For example, irrelevant electronic information can hamper efforts
to locate and produce information or records that are requested in litigation. This can lead to substantial monetary
sanctions when required records or information are not timely produced. See In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. Sales
Practices Litig., 169 F.R.D. 598, 615 (D.N.J. 1997) (“While there is no proof that Prudential, through its employees,
engaged in conduct intended to thwart discovery through the purposeful destruction of documents, its haphazard and
uncoordinated approach to document retention indisputably denies its party opponents potential evidence to establish
facts in dispute. Because the destroyed records in Cambridge are permanently lost, the Court will draw the inference
that the destroyed materials are relevant and if available would lead to the proof of a claim.”). See also, “Hit ‘Delete’ to
Prevent EDD Disaster”, Stanley M. Gibson (August 7, 2007) at http://www.law.com/jsp/legaltechnology/

  It is important to note that not all threatened litigation or conceivable disputes will trigger preservation obligations. The analysis, however, must be done on a case-by-case basis and
organizations should be prepared to analyze such situations as they arise. See Guideline 5.

  ANSI standards provides for storage of magnetic and digital information. See, e.g., ANSI Standard IT9.23-1998 (providing guidelines for storage of polyester based magnetic tapes).
These standards include monitoring of temperature and humidity levels, physical security, magnetic field restrictions, acceptable fire retardants, exercising magnetic tape to prevent
stiction, etc. (“Stiction” is short for “static friction,” a condition in which a hard drive’s read/write heads become stuck to the disk’s platters with enough strength to keep the platters from
spinning, resulting in hard drive failure. See http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/stiction.html).



                                                                                                                                                                                              23
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                                                                              November 2007

costs by identifying information of value to it, and reducing the amount of irrelevant electronic information that it
retains. See Smith v. Texaco, Inc., 951 F. Supp. 109, 112 (E.D. Tex. 1997), settled and dismissed, 281 F.3d 477 (5th Cir.
2002) (court upheld temporary restraining order prohibiting defendants from altering or destroying documents related
to employment discrimination litigation; however, given the high cost of electronic storage, court permitted deletion
of electronic documents in the ordinary course of business so long as hard copies were kept).

Managing superfluous information does not merely result in unnecessary costs. It also drains an organization’s limited
internal and external human and material resources. It diverts the organization’s internal resources from advancing the
organization’s principal business objectives of efficiency and productivity. It diminishes the organization’s ability to
compete in the marketplace, while unduly increasing the cost of doing business. The need to deal with the issues that
can arise from having too much information in litigation may divert the attention of an organization’s outside counsel
from strategic and substantive issues to matters of discovery and process.

Courts routinely acknowledge that organizations have the “right” to destroy (or not track or capture, whether or not it
is consciously deleted) electronic information that does not meet the internal criteria of information or records
requiring retention. Arthur Andersen, LLP v. United States, 544 U.S. 696, 125 S. Ct. 2129, 2135 (2005) (“‘Document
retention policies,’ which are created in part to keep certain information from getting into the hands of others,
including the Government, are common in business.”); see McGuire v. Acufex Microsurgical, Inc., 175 F.R.D. 149, 155
56 (D. Mass. 1997) (holding in the employment context, while there is no broad right to “broom clean” internal
investigation files or edit personnel records “willy-nilly,” employers may call for and edit drafts, and discard them
where there are errors made by someone other than the accuser and noting that “[to] hold otherwise would be to
create a new set of affirmative obligations for employers, unheard of in the law—to preserve all drafts of internal
memos, perhaps even to record everything no matter how central to the investigation, or gratuitous”); cf. Stevenson v.
Union Pac. R.R., 354 F.3d 739, 748-49 (8th Cir. 2004) (recognizing legitimate aspects of a retention program that
resulted in the destruction of materials relevant to the litigation). But see Morris v. Union Pac. R.R., 373 F.3d 896 at
900 01 (8th Cir. 2004) (holding that adverse inference instruction sanction for destruction of engineer-dispatcher
audiotape made at the time of accident was improper, distinguishing facts in Stevenson).


             Illustration i. Company A, which does not have an automated program to enforce e mail retention and
             disposition, collects 1 million pages in e mail and associated attachments from 25 employees in preparing a
             response to a government investigation. All pages are data converted and scanned at a cost of $0.20/page, a
             total of $200,000. A team of attorneys reviews the collection for relevance to the request and for privilege
             determinations at a cost of $0.50/page, $500,000 total. Upon completion of the culling process it is found
             that 10%, or 100,000 pages were responsive to the request. Company A has spent $700,000 to produce
             100,000 pages. It is safe to estimate that between 50–75% of the records retained in the employee’s e mail
             accounts did not have “retention value.” Therefore, Company A has spent between $350,000–$525,000 on
             processing records that had no value and were retained for no purpose.44


It should be noted, however, that deciding not to track or capture electronic information does not render that
information immune from discovery should litigation ensue. Accordingly, an organization may reduce the amount of
superfluous electronic information that it retains even where litigation is involved, provided that its preservation
obligations are met. See Guideline 5.

  The figures used are hypothetical and other approaches and cost figures would yield different results. The point is simply that the larger the volume of information the higher the costs
will be in litigation, separate and apart from any substantive impact the information may have on the outcome.

               Comment 3.b.
               Systematic deletion of electronic information is not synonymous with evidence spoliation.

Proper destruction of electronic records or other information consistent with a reasonable approach to managing
information and records is not synonymous with spoliation of evidence or obstruction of justice. Absent
extraordinary circumstances, if an organization has implemented a clearly defined records management program
specifying what information and records should be kept for legal, financial, operational or knowledge value reasons
and has set appropriate retention systems or periods, then information not meeting these retention guidelines can, and
should, be destroyed. Destruction of this information is not spoliation of evidence. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(f )45
(“Electronically stored information. Absent exceptional circumstances, a court may not impose sanctions under these
Rules on a party for failing to provide electronically stored information lost as a result of the routine, good-faith
operation of an electronic information system.”)46; Crandall v. City of Denver, 2006 WL 2683754 at *2 (D. Colo.
Sept.19, 2006) (“Mere existence of a document [in this case e-mail] destruction policy within a corporate entity,
coupled with a failure to put a comprehensive “hold” on that policy once the corporate entity becomes aware of
litigation, does not suffice to justify a sanction absent some proof that, in fact, it is potentially relevant evidence that
has been spoiled or destroyed.”); Willard v. Caterpillar, Inc., 48 Cal. Rptr. 2d 607 (Cal. Ct. App. 1995) (“good faith
disposal pursuant to a bona fide consistent and reasonable document retention policy could justify a failure to produce
documents in discovery”), overruled on other grounds by Cedars-Sinai Med. Ctr. v. Superior Court, 18 Cal. 4th 1, 954
P.2d 511 (Cal. Ct. 1998); Lewy v. Remington Arms Co., 836 F.2d 1104 (8th Cir. 1988) (directing the district court on
remand to consider the following factors in deciding whether to instruct the jury regarding failure to produce
evidence: (1) whether the records management policy is reasonable considering the facts and circumstances
surrounding the relevant documents; (2) whether the policy was adopted in bad faith; and (3) whether lawsuits have
been filed or complaints made in the past with such frequency or in such magnitude that it is obvious that certain
categories of documents should be retained);47 see also Vick v. Tex. Employment Comm’n, 514 F.2d 734, 737 (5th Cir.
1975) (affirming trial court’s refusal to draw adverse inference whether documents were destroyed pursuant to
Commission regulations governing disposal of inactive records); Moore v. Gen. Motors Corp., 558 S.W.2d 720, 735
(Mo. Ct. App. 1977) (“Anyone knowledgeable of business practices and the cost of storing records in these times
would find it reasonable and not smacking of fraud for the defendant, with no knowledge of pending litigation, to
follow its customary practice [of destroying records].”); Chrysler Corp. v. Blackmon, 841 S.W.2d 844, 847 50, 853
(Tex. 1992) (holding in products liability action, extreme sanction of default judgment was not warranted where car
manufacturer failed to produce crash test reports and other documents that had been destroyed pursuant to document
retention policy); Stapper v. GMI Holdings, Inc., No. A091872, 2001 WL 1664920, at *9 (Cal. App. Dec. 31, 2001)
(finding trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to allow evidence that copies of complaints made
before 1995 had been destroyed pursuant to a document retention policy when there was no evidence of a willful
attempt to suppress evidence and plaintiff had access to computer records with brief summaries of complaints dating
to 1982). Cf. Optowave Co., Ltd. v. Nikitin, 2006 WL 3231422 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 7, 2006) (failure to suspend normal
retention policies, resulting in destruction of relevant evidence, following notice of possible litigation sufficient to

bad faith where documents intentionally destroyed in accordance with existing document retention policy, where
party had notice of potential litigation and relevance of documents prior to destruction date).

     Fed. R. Civ. P 37(f ) is anticipated to be renumbered as Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e) effective December 1, 2007. See footnote 10, supra.
46
  The Advisory Committee Note to this amended Rule makes clear that “good-faith” includes proper implementation of a legal hold where necessary: “Good faith may require a party
intervene to modify or suspend certain features of the routine operation of a computer system to prevent the loss of information, if that information is subject to a preservation
obligation.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(f ) 2006 Advisory Committee Note. Although the amended Rule provides support for the contention that not all destruction of electronic information is
spoliation, the Rule does not provide specific guidance as to what else defines “good faith,” or what might constitute “exceptional circumstances” that would warrant sanctions. Further,
the Rule does not prohibit a court from issuing sanctions under its own inherent authority, or under any other statutory authority. Accordingly, Rule 37(f ) is not in and of itself a “safe
harbor” so much as it is a general guideline.
47
   Some commentators argue that Residential Funding Corp. v. DeGeorge Fin. Corp., 306 F.3d 99 (2nd Cir. 2002) (“RFC”) creates a pure negligence standard for spoliation, which may be
seen as casting doubt on the continued validity of these cases. RFC does hold that “discovery sanctions, including an adverse inference instruction, may be imposed upon a party that has
breached a discovery obligation not only through bad faith or gross negligence, but also through ordinary negligence.” This may be an overbroad interpretation of the importance of the
RFC case, which read carefully may be significantly limited by its facts. By comparison, the case of Stevenson v. Union Pac. R.R., 354 F.3d 739, 745 51 (8th Cir. 2004) makes it clear that
the requirement for intentional or bad faith destruction is critical to analyzing “culpability” to determine what sanctions, if any, should attach to the loss of evidence. See also Greyhound
Lines, Inc. v. Wade, 2007 WL 1189451 *2 (8th Cir. 2007) (“The ultimate focus for imposing sanctions for spoliation of evidence is the intentional destruction of evidence indicating a
desire to suppress the truth, not the prospect of litigation.”)



                                                                                                                                                                                           25

Where an organization in good faith adopts a reasonable document retention policy, and its operation and procedures
are rational, it should be permitted to continue those procedures after commencement of litigation, assuming
reasonable steps have been taken to preserve data relevant to actual or reasonably anticipated litigation, government
investigation or audit. See Martin H. Redish, Electronic Discovery and the Litigation Matrix, 51 Duke L.J. 561, 621
(2001) (“(1) Electronic evidence destruction, if done routinely in the ordinary course of business, does not
automatically give rise to an inference of knowledge of specific documents’ destruction, much less intent to destroy
those documents for litigation-related reasons, and (2) to prohibit such routine destruction could impose substantial
costs and disruptive burdens on commercial enterprises.”). Similar rules should apply before the formal
commencement of litigation. See generally Morris v. Union Pac. R.R., 373 F.3d 896, 900-01 (8th Cir. 2004) (holding
that adverse inference instruction sanction for destruction of engineer-dispatcher audiotape made at the time of
accident was improper in circumstances of case); Stevenson v. Union Pac. R.R., 354 F.3d 739, 748-49 (8th Cir. 2004)
(holding adverse inference instruction was in error where records were destroyed pursuant to a document retention
policy of a time when litigation was not imminent; distinguishing circumstance where pre litigation destruction of
engineer-dispatcher audiotape made at time of grade crossing accident was sanctionable); Vick v. Tex. Employment
Comm’n, 514 F.2d 734, 737 (5th Cir. 1975) (affirming trial court’s refusal to draw adverse inference where documents
were destroyed pursuant to Commission regulations governing disposal of inactive records); Moore v. Gen. Motors
Corp., 558 S.W.2d 720, 735 (Mo. Ct. App. 1977) (holding spoliation doctrine inapplicable where records were
destroyed in accordance with company’s customary document retention policy before litigation was anticipated);
Chrysler Corp. v. Blackmon, 841 S.W.2d 844, 847 50, 853 (Tex. 1992) (holding sanction of default judgment not
warranted where documents were destroyed pursuant to document retention policy). It is imperative, however, that
destruction is carried out consistently and non selectively in conformance with the standard operating procedures for
the organization. See Comments 5.a, 5.b, and 5.e, below.


        Comment 3.c.
        Absent a legal requirement to the contrary, organizations may adopt programs that routinely delete certain
        recorded communications, such as electronic mail, instant messaging, text messaging and voice-mail.


Unless there is an applicable retention obligation imposed by statute or regulation, or there is a legal hold imposed by
virtue of litigation, audit or investigation (see Guideline 5), organizations can legitimately prescribe retention (or
deletion) periods for recorded communications, such as electronic mail, instant messaging, voice over IP, text
messaging and voice-mails. It bears emphasizing, however, that, to the extent the content communicated has value to
the organization, that content—rather than the form of the communication—should dictate its management. There
are several ways to approach the management of information exchanged through these communication devices. Some
organizations impose space requirements (e.g., size limits for e-mail boxes where users are unable to send new messages
once the limit is reached). Others impose time restrictions (e.g., all non-foldered e-mails more than thirty days old will
be automatically deleted). Indeed, organizations can set up Instant Messaging so that archiving of the typed
conversation is not allowed and the text disappears when the session is closed. Other organizations have used a hybrid
approach, which provides that most communications are to be deleted within a prescribed number of days, but
communications that have a true business critical nature can be retained for a longer period in public or shared folders.
For example, if there is a construction project, e-mails relating to that construction project may be maintained for the
life of the project in a public or shared folder, but should be deleted after the conclusion of the project.




                                                                                                                       26
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                     November 2007

As noted earlier, the selection of any particular solution involves complex and competing policy issues best resolved by
careful discussions among an interdisciplinary team. For example, while the information technology department may
effectively advocate a policy against using a network for individual archiving, employees can often archive messages on
their own local hard drives (e.g., with .pst files for e-mail within a Microsoft Outlook environment). This ad hoc
“work around” will result in additional time and cost if the scattered information needs to be retrieved or reproduced.
Organizations that rely heavily on e-mail may find it difficult to implement a strict disposal period without sufficient
safeguards to protect against the loss of important information. This highlights how important it is for organizations
to adopt policies, procedures and processes that best meet their business needs and fit their cultures, while satisfying
their legal obligations.
In addition, there may be some circumstances where an organization is legally obligated to retain all forms of
communications. For example, the investment industry is under a requirement to maintain for a specified period all
communications with certain investment customers. See 17 C.F.R. § 240.17a-4(b) and (4). Alternatively, some
organizations actually use e-mail to document specific transactions and, therefore, the e-mail itself might be a
transactional record that should be retained under the tax laws and regulations. Before implementing a policy
regarding the automatic destruction of electronic communications, the organization must have a good understanding
of its legal obligations as well as its business practices.
Moreover, any organization that normally deletes data on a regular schedule should be able to suspend such automatic
deletion (i.e., as part of a legal hold) for some or all users, or otherwise provide a retention process or mechanism, as
may be necessary to comply with preservation obligations. See generally John C. Montaña, Legal Obstacles to E-Mail
Message Destruction (ARMA Int’l Educ. Found. 2003). Furthermore, organizations that adopt a time or space based
approach should consider that the varying usage levels of different employees may result in the disparate application of
policies and inadvertent loss of valuable information unless there is adequate education and effective procedures to cull
records from non-relevant information. Indeed, a policy that routinely deletes “old” data (such as e-mail messages)
without any other protections can be analogized to destroying boxes in a warehouse based on where they are on the
shelf without any regard to the contents.
Organizations should also be free to migrate data from one form to another to create the record of an event or
transaction. For example, many organizations have customer call centers where voice messages or customer
conversations may be recorded. In the absence of a regulatory obligation, the organization, in the reasonable exercise
of its business judgment, may choose to transcribe part or all of the recorded message, preserving the transcription and
deleting the recording in the ordinary course. Similarly, some organizations employ unified messaging systems which
convert recorded voice messages into digital formats including e-mail, and vice versa. In the absence of a regulatory
obligation, the organization, in the reasonable exercise of its business judgment and consistent with a retention policy
it may adopt, may choose to retain the message in only one format, or not at all.

        Comment 3.d.
        Absent a legal requirement to the contrary, organizations may recycle or destroy hardware or media that
        contain data retained for business continuation or disaster recovery purposes.

If an organization has duplicated and retained data to ensure business continuity in the event of a disaster (such as a
system failure), the organization may routinely recycle that hardware or media (and destroy the temporarily retained
contents) as a matter of course. See Comment 2.e.
The mere existence of actual or reasonably anticipated litigation, investigation or audits should not ordinarily alter
such routine recycling and destruction provided that there are reasonable steps taken to preserve the relevant data
maintained in other locations within the organization for such purposes. However, each organization should consider
and be prepared to react to any unique circumstances that may require suspending the ordinary recycling and
destruction process if it is required by court order or otherwise (i.e., where the data is relevant and not being saved
through some other means). See generally Guideline 5 and commentary. See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2) 2006
Advisory Committee Note (“A party’s identification of sources of electronically stored information as not reasonably
accessible does not relieve the party of its common-law or statutory duties to preserve evidence.”)



                                                                                                                          27

             Comment 3.e.
             Absent a legal requirement to the contrary, organizations may systematically delete or destroy residual,
             shadowed or deleted data.

In the ordinary course of business, organizations routinely migrate information from old to new hardware and software
platforms at various times. An organization need not copy and retain the residual, shadowed or deleted data48 that
may reside on the old hardware, media or system platform. Instead, as part of the migration and recycling process,
such data can be routinely destroyed. In addition, organizations may routinely use processes that delete temporary
data (such as residual, shadowed or deleted data) from company computers. This would include temporary files such
as cached website files. Absent a specific legal or business need, there are no impediments to such destruction.49

However, an organization that employs a routine system or program to destroy such data should undertake reasonable
steps to identify and retain unique data that must be retained in accordance with legal obligations and also institute
reasonable processes to suspend the routine destruction as may be required by court order or otherwise. See generally
Guideline 5 and commentary.

             Comment 3.f.
             Absent a legal requirement to the contrary, organizations are not required to preserve metadata, but may
             find it useful to do so in some instances.

Metadata50 is sometimes referred to as “data about data.” Metadata can come from a variety of sources: created
automatically by a computer, supplied by a user, or inferred through a relationship to another document.11 Some
metadata, such as file dates and sizes, can easily be seen by users; other metadata may be hidden or embedded and
unavailable to computer users who are not technically adept. Metadata may connect to electronic information or
records in a variety of ways. The electronic information or record may contain a reference to the metadata, or vice
versa. For example, a hypertext document may contain a link to an index that provides information about its context.
A folder or directory listing may contain a reference to the location where the content of the electronic document is
found.
Metadata is created, modified and disposed of at many points during the life of electronic information, and in the
ordinary course of business organizations routinely migrate information from one form to another affecting the
metadata associated with those files. For instance, some organizations use a printed or imaged document as the final
or official version of a record. Printing an electronic document to an image (such as .tif or .pdf formats) or paper can
eliminate some or all of the metadata associated with the electronic version of the document.

 According to ISO 1548-1, metadata is “data describing context, content, and structure of records and their management through time.” See also The Sedona Conference® Glossary for E-
Discovery and Digital Information Management (2d Edition) available at: www.thesedonaconference.org.



                                                                                                                                                                                         28
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                                                                                  November 2007

Absent a specific legal or business need, an organization need not retain the electronic version of a document and its
associated metadata.51 Indeed, the National Archives has mandated the paper retention of records in a number of
instances. Cf. Pub. Citizen v. Carlin, 184 F.3d 900, 909-10 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (finding it appropriate under federal
statute for agencies to maintain record-keeping systems in the form most appropriate to the business of the agency,
reflecting its administrative, legal, research and other values, and without regard to the prospective interests of future
researchers).
It should be observed that metadata includes contextual, processing, and use information which can assist with
identification and certification of the scope, authenticity, and integrity of electronically stored information, including
electronically stored records.52 Because metadata may provide a wealth of information that can allow an organization
to better retain and organize its information, organizations may find the retention and use of metadata to be beneficial
from an organizational or operational perspective. Furthermore, organizations may wish to consider retaining
sufficient metadata about records to ensure the trustworthiness of the records for organizational, fiscal, legal and
historical purposes.53 And many organizations employ information and records management programs that specifically
use metadata tags to cull and organize information.54 Finally, it may be that certain metadata is critical to an
organization’s ability to audit and track access to information so that it can, for example, identify and stop any
improper access to sensitive information by unauthorized personnel. Thus, for some organizations it may be
unworkable and unwise to routinely discard metadata. An organization should consider the best format in which to
retain information to meet good business practices as well as legal requirements. See Comment 4.f.
If an organization chooses to retain metadata in its normal course of business, it should be aware that the metadata
may be discoverable in its complete and original form. See, e.g., Williams v. Sprint, 230 F.R.D. 640, 652 (D. Kan.
2005) (court ruled that presumption is in favor of producing metadata unless (1) producing party objects; (2) parties
agree otherwise; or (3) court issues a protective order); see also Nova Measuring Instruments Ltd. v. Nanometrics, Inc.,
417 F. Supp. 2d 1121, 1122 (N.D. Cal. 2006) magistrate granted motion to compel defendant to produce electronic
documents in native format with all original metadata, where defendant originally agreed to such production and
provided no reason why it could not make such production); In re NYSE Securities Specialists Litigation, 2006 WL
1704447, at *1 (S.D. N.Y. June 14, 2006) (court ordered all electronic documents to be produced in native format,




_________________
51
  It is important to distinguish the ordinary situation from what might be required in a litigation context where an obligation to preserve metadata might be imposed. Organizations
faced with the preservation obligations due to litigation or investigation and a desire to migrate information from one format to another should seek advice from competent legal counsel
as to their obligations surrounding preservation relevant metadata. See The Sedona Principles, Second Edition (2007), Principle 14 for additional guidance.

52
  For records to remain accessible and intelligible over time, it may be necessary to preserve and migrate the metadata associated with those records. If records that are currently being
created are to have a chance of surviving migrations through successive generations of computer hardware and software, or removal to entirely new delivery systems, they will need to have
metadata that enables them to exist independently of the system that currently being used to store and retrieve them. Technical, descriptive and preservation metadata that documents
how a record was created and maintained, how it behaves and how it relates to other records will all be essential.
53
  At the same time it should be recognized that too strict of reliance on metadata can cause anomalies in records and information management. For example, some software applications
carry forward the original author’s name in the metadata. Thus, if another person, in creating a new record (e.g., a letter), copies it and then modifies it with new information, it may still
reflect the name of the original creator of the record used to recreate the format in the metadata of the new record. In such case, the metadata for the new record may be misleading as to
the “real” author of the new record.
54
   See e.g., the Minnesota Recordkeeping Metadata Standard, which is designed to support the accountability of government and the proper use of government records as mandated by law.
The standard addresses many metadata elements, and other issues such as access restrictions, data practices, and records retention and disposition, thereby enabling the practical
implementation of statutory mandates for records management. Use of the standard can: (a) facilite data sharing, (b) enhance efficiency with respect to locating, evaluating, and retrieving
records, and (c) provide guidance to consultants, vendors, and system designers. The standard is comprised of ten mandatory and ten voluntary elements. It is referenced as a “current
standard” in the Minnesota Enterprise Technical Architecture under Chapter 4, “Data and Records Management Architecture.” See also http://metadata-stds.org/ (homepage of ISO/IEC
JTC1 SC32 WG2, which is the Working Group within the ISO that develops international standards for metadata and related technologies); http://dublincore.org/ (The Dublin Core
Metadata Initiative is an open organization engaged in the development of interoperable online metadata standards that support a broad range of purposes and business models. DCMI’s

along with all associated metadata). See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(b) (allowing a requesting party to request electronically
stored information in either the form “in which it is ordinarily maintained,” or a form that is “reasonably usable”).
But see Williams v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., 2006 WL 3691604 (D. Kan. Dec. 12, 2006) (denying class action
employment discrimination plaintiffs’ request to require defendant to produce emails that transmitted certain
spreadsheets in native format because plaintiffs had not provided sufficient reasons for requiring native production and
defendant had raised convincing argument that redaction of privileged information was not technologically feasible in
native format); CP Solutions PTE, LTD. v. Gen. Elec. Co., et al., 2006 WL 1272615 (D. Conn. Feb. 6, 2006)
(declining to order production of documents in native (.pst) format in a breach of contract and fraud case absent
showing of need for a specific .pst file and a means to secure it without the production of privileged or irrelevant
documents); In re Priceline.com, Inc. Sec. Litig., 2005 WL 3465942 (D. Conn. Dec. 8, 2005) (directing that
information be produced in non-native formats absent a showing that production of a file in its native format would
be necessary to view or comprehend the information in the file).
Additionally, if in the ordinary course of business an organization migrates electronic versions with associated metadata
to other versions without retaining that metadata, the organization should consider if and how it would preserve
electronic versions including metadata if it has actual notice (by court order or otherwise) that the metadata is material
and needs to be preserved. For example, lawsuits may involve a need to examine the metadata associated with
documents to establish facts regarding the document and its genesis, modification or distribution in particular
instances. In those specific situations where particular metadata is known to be material to the dispute, the loss of
such metadata may be seen as spoliation of evidence, which can have negative consequences for the organization. See
generally Guideline 5 and commentary. See also The Sedona Principles, Second Edition (2007), Principle No. 12 and

4.       An organization adopting an information and records management policy should also develop procedures
         that address the creation, identification, retention, retrieval and ultimate disposition or destruction of
         information and records.
As explained earlier, an organization has considerable latitude in choosing how to manage its information and records.
In this section we examine issues an organization may consider in formulating procedures to create or maintain a
successful retention program. As noted earlier, there is no “one size fits all” approach to such retention programs.
Organizations will take different approaches, even internally, based upon their unique history, facts and circumstances.
Importantly, there must be an explicit recognition that there will be substantial differences in the approach of a
20-employee local operation versus that of a 100,000 employee multinational corporation. That said, like other
aspects of corporate governance, the consistent application of the specific policies and procedures that are adopted will
greatly enhance the likelihood that the program will meet its intended objectives. See ISO 15489-1.

         Comment 4.a.
         Information and records management policies must be put into practice.

The responsible handling of electronic information and records should be considered a core value of an organization.
To be effective and defensible, policies should not be written and then filed on a shelf, never to be looked at again.
Indeed, a policy in name only may be worse than no policy at all. Incomplete or inadequate execution of an electronic
information and records management policy may result in the loss of valuable business information. For example,
employees may unknowingly destroy electronic information before the end of its useful life, or store so much useless
electronic information that useful information is difficult to identify or access when needed.

         Comment 4.b.
         Information and records management policies and practices should be documented.

An organization that has adopted a retention policy should also consider documenting its records retention efforts.
The extent of the documentation will vary between organizations, and even among its several business units. A
balance should be struck between making the documentation comprehensive and the critical need for the
documentation to be comprehended by those tasked with executing the policies and procedures. Thus, the
documentation could include an umbrella policy, procedures applicable to various departments, divisions or units,
retention schedule(s), answers to FAQs, copies of the training materials and resources, as well as any documents
reflecting updates or changes to the policy or implementation of its provisions.

         Comment 4.c.
         An organization should define roles and responsibilities for program direction and administration within
         its information and records management policies.

Effective implementation of a reasonable information and records management policy requires the participation of
individuals throughout the organization. However, some individuals necessarily have greater responsibilities in
ensuring the policy’s success. A clear delineation of roles and responsibilities will benefit all, and help foster the
teamwork that is essential to the effort. See Comment 2.b.
In larger organizations prepared to invest in the process, those individuals with greater responsibilities often include:


     •   Executives and senior management, who may oversee the creation of the information and records
         management policy and strategy, should provide the resources for initial and ongoing implementation and
         compliance, and should periodically review operational realities of the program;
     •   Records officers, who should (where applicable) help design and later manage the information and records
         policy and overall records management program;



                                                                                                                            31
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                       November 2007

    •   Legal department or compliance officers, who should be responsible for coordinating legal retention
        obligations, including legal holds;
    •   Business unit managers, who may help establish internal procedures to ensure that records of business
        transactions and events are created, received and retained to meet business and legal requirements; and
    •   The organization’s officer or senior manager for information systems, who should be responsible for the
        reliability and continuing operation of systems used to generate, retain and dispose of electronic information
        and records; and
    •   The organization’s officer(s) or senior manager(s) for data security and privacy, who are responsible for
        compliance with federal, state and local laws relating to retention and destruction of personally identifiable
        information.


Not all organizations will have the resources or personnel available or will identify a need to fill such positions.
However, the manner by which an organization addresses its responsibilities is not as important as the basic
identification and distribution of responsibilities so that the information and records management program can
succeed in practice.
The absence of a well-coordinated multidisciplinary approach has hurt organizations in the litigation context when the
preservation of data was at issue: See, Morgan v. U.S. Xpress, Inc., 2006 WL 1548029, at *5 (M.D. Ga. June 2, 2006)

Special attention should be given to identifying an individual with broad understanding of the process who,
if necessary, may serve as the witness if the policy becomes an issue. Indeed, in light of recent proposals at the state
and federal court levels, such a witness may need to be identified early in any litigation. Cf. U.S. Dist. Ct. Ark. L.R.
26; U.S. Dist. Ct. N.J. L.R. 26; U.S. Dist. Wyo. L.R. 26; see Default Standard for the Discovery of Electronic
Documents, (“E-Discovery”) (D. Del. 2004) (J. Robinson), available at www.ded.uscourts.gov/SLRmain.htm.
The policy should be visibly supported by senior management. Courts in the discovery context expect that
management within organizations will attend to document retention issues in a meaningful fashion. See Danis v. USN
Communications, Inc., No. 98 C 7482, 2000 WL 1694325, at *40-41, 53 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 23, 2000) (failure to take
reasonable steps to preserve data at the outset of discovery resulted in a personal fine levied against the defendant’s
CEO); In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. Sales Practice Litig., 169 F.R.D. 598, 615 (D.N.J. 1997) (“The obligation to
preserve documents that are potentially discoverable materials is an affirmative one that rests squarely on the shoulders
of senior corporate officers.”); see also Daniel L. Pelc and Jonathan M. Redgrave, Challenges for Corporate Counsel in the
Land of E-Discovery: Lessons from a Case Study, 3 Andrews E-BUSINESS LAW BULLETIN 1 (Feb. 2002). In determining
the reasonableness of a retention policy, courts may also look to the level of support from senior management.

             Comment 4.d.
             An organization should guide employees regarding how to identify and maintain information that has a
             business purpose or is required to be maintained by law or regulation.

An organization’s technology and information created with that technology are not the property of the individual
employee. They are assets of the organization and should be managed accordingly. The organization’s policy should
set forth a process used to identify what should be retained and establish parameters to be used when selecting the
most appropriate media for retention.
The records management profession generally speaks in terms of an “official record” or the official version of a record.
The legal profession has long used the term “original,” at least with regard to evidentiary requirements. See FED. R.
EVID. 1002 (“To prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, the original writing, recording, or
photograph is required, except as otherwise provided in these rules or by Act of Congress.”); cf. FED. R. EVID. 1003
(“A duplicate is admissible to the same extent as an original unless (1) a genuine question is raised as to the
authenticity of the original or (2) in the circumstances it would be unfair to admit the duplicate in lieu of the
original.”). With electronic information, such distinctions may be elusive. An organization should seek to establish
criteria for determining the form and version of a record that is most appropriate to meeting its business and legal
needs.
An organization should also consider the issue of “draft” documents and make rational decisions concerning their
retention or destruction based on articulated business needs or legal requirements. Designating one version of data or
an electronic record as the authoritative or official version does not eliminate the need to manage other versions of that
electronic information which may exist as drafts or duplicates saved by the author or recipient(s). See Donald Skupsky,
Establishing Records Retention Periods for Electronic Records, INFORMATION RECORDS CLEARINGHOUSE, available at
http://www.irch.com/articles/articl09.pdf (last visited Aug. 24, 2005).55 Draft records include working files such as
preliminary drafts, notes, supporting source documents and similar materials. Retaining draft records may assist in
reconstructing events, such as the negotiations of a contract or license, and for that reason may have value to the
organization. If draft records are shared with outsiders, it may also be useful to retain one complete set of those drafts
that were exchanged (but not all internal drafts and comments) as proof of the development of the final document.

        Illustration i. The Director of Global Research for a company is engaged in biotechnology licensing
        negotiations with another company that is a direct competitor in some markets. A license is obtained
        and later there is a dispute about the scope of its terms. The Director is certain that a key term to
        support his company’s position was inserted by a member of the opposing negotiation team. Others
        from his own team have left the company or have no memory of the exact negotiations. With the
        help of his lawyers he is able to reconstruct the drafting history from the set of exchanged drafts
        retained by the legal department.
However, absent a specific legal requirement, in most circumstances drafts of policies, memos, reports and the like will
not have continuing value to the organization and need not be retained once a final record has been created. For
example, draft employee evaluations could conceivably contain unique information and mental impressions
concerning a decision or action, yet some courts recognize they need not be retained. See, e.g., McGuire v. Acufex
Microsurgical, Inc., 175 F.R.D. 149, 153-56 (D. Mass. 1997) (no obligation to preserve all drafts of internal memos
and no sanctionable conduct in deleting a paragraph from a personnel evaluation even after state discrimination
commission proceedings commenced; court found that employer had obligation to make sure that no false
information was placed into personnel file; employer could review drafts of personnel memoranda and discard them
with the editing related to obvious errors made by someone other than the accused harasser). On the other hand,
drafts must be retained if they are relevant to actual or reasonably anticipated litigation, government investigation, or
audit. Trigon Ins. Co. v. United States, 204 F.R.D. 277, 288-91 (E.D. Va. 2001) (breach of duty to preserve drafts of
expert reports warrants sanctions). In such instance a legal hold should be issued to specify the need to retain records
that could otherwise be discarded.
In short, an organization should consider procedures by which it captures versions of the information or record that
have a separate business need for retention (e.g., meaningful drafts, etc.), but then presumptively discard the rest
(absent some preservation requirement).


        Comment 4.e.
        An organization may wish to consider defining (formally or informally) the roles and responsibilities of
        employees regarding electronic information and records.

Electronic information and records management is enhanced when records have custodians throughout their existence
to ensure their credibility, reliability, accessibility and ultimate disposition or destruction. Accordingly, defining the
roles and responsibilities of employees regarding electronic information and records may improve an organization’s
control over its information and records. An electronic record may require different “custodians” throughout its
lifecycle, just as different “custodians” may have different roles with respect to the development, implementation, and
supervision of an information and records management policy. See Pat Franks and Nancy Kunde, Why Metadata
Matters, The Information Management Journal, Vol. 40, No. 5 (Sept/Oct. 2006) (noting that it is common to see
“representatives of information technology, business units, records management, and legal services” involved in the
development of policies and procedures relating to electronic records).

Business unit or process owner employees may establish and maintain procedural controls to ensure that appropriate
electronic records are created, received and retained to meet business and legal requirements. This may include the
originator or recipient of an electronic record, or their successors in the business unit function, during the normal
course of business activities. As the “content custodians” for electronic records they will address creation and
preservation of the information from a business need and legal standpoint, and are responsible for authorizing the
destruction of electronic information and records in accordance with approved retention schedule. They may also be
responsible for preserving electronic information and records due to actual or reasonably anticipated litigation,
government investigation or audit.

Technology custodians are generally responsible for the logistical and physical care of electronic records. Technology
custodians ensure that the automated environment used to generate or receive electronic records: (a) maintains
appropriate metadata and content infrastructure; (b) provides mechanisms to validate electronic records authenticity
and ownership; (c) protects active electronic records by implementing a comprehensive disaster recovery strategy;

                                                                                                                         34
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                      November 2007

(d) archives inactive electronic records needed to satisfy long-term operational, historical or compliance requirements;
(e) preserves electronic records and information as needed to meet litigation, investigation or audit requirements; and
(f ) applies the disposition requirements specified in the retention policy established by the organization to those
electronic records that have exceeded their approved retention periods and that are not subject to any legal holds.

An organization may determine, especially where information has been the subject of a legal hold, that content and
technology custodians should share responsibility for final disposition orders. Content custodians and technology
custodians can also establish procedures to transfer the ownership of electronic information and records from one
business function to the next, for example, during the course of organizational changes such as reorganizations,
acquisitions/divestitures and employee retirement, termination or reassignment. See Comment 4.j.




        Comment 4.f.
        An organization should consider the impact (including potential benefits) of technology on the creation,
        retention and destruction of information and records.




For many reasons, identifying, capturing and managing electronic information and records may be a more difficult
task than for paper records. The volume of electronic information generated, received and at least temporarily retained
as a function of technology is significantly greater than the volume of paper information previously generated. This
creates challenges in identifying and managing this greater scope of electronic information. Different aspects of
electronic information create different issues for storing, maintaining and transmitting information.
As a best practice, organizations should consider IT functions, structure and capabilities in developing an information
and records retention policy and program. Indeed, emerging technical solutions may obviate a number of previously
required human steps in classifying data in some organizations. Further, an organization should consider the impact
on its retention program of proposals to migrate to new technologies or applications. For example, adopting a unified
messaging system that translates recorded voice messages into digitized text files that can be stored and searched just
like e-mail may have significant implications for an organization’s retention program. Similarly, as today’s teenagers,
the overwhelming majority of whom use instant messaging daily, enter the mainstream workforce, it is likely that
instant messaging and other emerging technologies will have a substantial impact on information retention practices
and procedures. See “Teens and Technology: Youth are Leading the Transition to a Fully Wired and Mobile Nation,”
PEW/Internet, July 27, 2005, available at http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/162/report_display.asp.
Metadata: An organization’s information and records management policy should consider whether to preserve
metadata for purposes of authentication, security, data integrity, search, retrieval and analysis. Metadata carries with it
a number of considerations that are discussed here and in further detail in Comment 3.f, above. Metadata should be
examined from the perspective of how it can benefit the organization in its ordinary and ongoing operations. Much of
the metadata stored by computer systems may be meaningless from the legal or records management perspective. For
example, when documents are created, the system automatically generates a variety of identifying numbers and
addresses that are used purely for systems purposes, and in some types of records management systems, retaining




                                                                                                                        35
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                                                                                November 2007

excessive metadata can needlessly increase costs of storage and complexity of a records management system. However,
in many instances certain metadata fields may be invaluable resources to aid information and records management.56
As noted in Introduction to Metadata: Pathways to Digital Information, Online Edition, version 2.157, published by the J.
Paul Getty Trust, in the context of a network environment metadata can certify the authenticity and degree of
completeness of the content of objects; establish and document the context of the content; identify and exploit
structural relationships that exist between and within information objects; provide a range of intellectual access points
for an increasingly diverse range of users; and provides some of the information an information professional might
have provided in a physical reference or research setting. Therefore, establishing standard metadata criteria (i.e., what
information will be preserved and in what form) can also result in substantial savings in retrieval and storage costs.58
There will always be important tradeoffs between the costs of developing and managing metadata to meet current
needs, and creating sufficient metadata that can be capitalized upon for future, often unanticipated uses. As
organizations develop records systems, they should consider which aspects of metadata are essential for what they wish
to achieve and how detailed they need each type of metadata to be. An organization may require frequent ad-hoc
discovery searches across information systems, protection from inadvertent destruction of documents or e-mail
messages, or it may need to prevent disclosure of sensitive trade secrets from being re-distributed or copied.


               Illustration ii. Beta Corporation does not have a formal document management system, and it has
               discovered that it often has difficulty locating records that are needed for reporting purposes. Beta’s
               records management specialist has recommended the use of document profiling within its document
               management software. By automatically recording basic information about the document that is
               supplemented by the author, important records can be located much more quickly through the use of
               simple searches on this metadata within the document management system.
Searching capabilities can be significantly enhanced through the existence of rich, consistent metadata. Searching is
generally used in records management to select and/or classify data. For example, proper searching can help with the
assignment of electronic documents, files and messages into appropriate records management categories. Metadata
such as dates, folder information, subject designations and other properties can help generate or validate classifications
of the item. Metadata such as e-mail thread information can be used to help assure that related items are maintained
in context and/or treated consistently. If descriptive metadata are the same or can be mapped across different
electronic repositories, metadata can also make it possible to search across multiple collections or to create virtual
collections from materials that are distributed across repositories.
Some types of metadata continue to undergo changes that may increase the difficulty of electronic records
management and production of electronic documents for legal proceedings. For example, on some (but not all)
existing systems, the user or system administrator can control access to and usage of files and messages by rights or
permissions. These constraints can themselves be important metadata properties for legal or records management
purposes, and can also impact an organization’s ability to store or review its own data. In order to ensure that all data
can be accessed for purposes of the legal or records management function, permissions or rights to the data must be
taken into consideration. Likewise, the legal and records management functions can be affected by encryption of data,
procedures for compression and encoding, and other technologies that can make data difficult to identify or review.

Individuals who create and transmit electronic documents are often unaware of the existence of readable metadata that
may inadvertently reveal privileged or confidential information to adversaries and other outside parties. Organizations
should consider adopting policies to provide guidance to users regarding the transmission of metadata. Moreover,

  Certain metadata is critical in information management and for ensuring effective retrieval and accountability in record-keeping. Metadata can assist in proving the authenticity of the
content of electronic documents, as well as establish the context of the content. Metadata can also identify and exploit the structural relationships that exist between and within electronic
documents, such as versions and drafts. Metadata allows organizations to track the many layers of rights and reproduction information that exist for records and their multiple versions.
Metadata may also document other legal or security requirements that have been imposed on records; for example, privacy concerns, privileged communications or work product, or
proprietary interests.

   In addition to the Getty publication referenced above, the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative may be useful to consider in evaluating what metadata elements are important to an
organization’s information and records management. See http://dublincore.org. The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative describes itself as an open organization engaged in the development
of interoperable online metadata standards that support a broad range of purposes and business models. Additional resources may be found at

The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                                                                      November 2007

many organizations publishing data on external (i.e., publicly accessible) web-based communication tools may not be
fully aware of the metadata that may be viewed by individuals outside the organization and even captured and indexed
by outside search engines. There are a variety of methods for managing and controlling the extent of metadata
transmitted with the core data. Some formats designed for transmission of data, such as XML, provide the
functionality for the organization to determine which metadata fields are and are not transmitted with the core data.
Other formats, such as .pdf or .tif can be used to remove certain metadata from the core document and to standardize
the manner in which the document is maintained. Similarly, “metadata stripper” technology, which removes some or
all of the metadata from a native electronic file; however, such technology is not available for all types of data and may
not be easily usable by end-users. Other technologies may be available for these purposes. Each technology embodies
a different approach to the storage and transmission of the core document and metadata, and each may be appropriate
in a given set of circumstances, depending on a variety of considerations, including usability of the data, cost,
governmental rules and regulations, and other factors.

Electronic Archives: Electronic archives are repositories for electronic records in a form that facilitates searching,
reporting, analysis, production, preservation and disposition. When properly set up and maintained, electronic
archives are not solely static collections of records (whether on-line or off-line on mass media such as tapes or optical
media). An organization should consider whether, and to what extent, it uses electronic archives to store data with
long-term operational, legal or historical value. Electronic archives preserve and support access to digital information
and records with long retention periods that are at risk from technological obsolescence. Ensuring access to records in
an electronic archive may be a component of an organization’s best practices approach to an information and records
management policy. Electronic records with continuing operational, legal or historical value may be transferred from
active systems to an electronic archive. If an organization does not have an archive, special care should be taken that
these records and information are otherwise properly protected. A comprehensive archive may act as a repository for
both electronic and non-electronic records and thus can facilitate an integrated search of all records in all formats in
the event of litigation, investigation or audit.59

The key to maximizing the utility of an electronic archive is the availability of record metadata—especially metadata
that cannot be easily derived from the record content—and record management data (such as the business owner, the
planned disposition date, various retention factors, etc.) along with the native record. This additional data may add
value for searching, reporting and analysis purposes. By adding value for business or user processes, electronic archive
systems can present a positive situation for all parties within an organization. Policies for access to long-term
electronic archives should consider requirements for current and post-disposition access to metadata and statistical
information. Long-term business needs for metadata should be weighed against risk and record management
requirements for comprehensive removal of both records and their associated metadata at the planned disposition
point. These long-term needs may include compliance reporting, productivity analysis, project task and cost analysis,
and other forms of detailed and statistical reporting.

The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                                                                                   November 2007

Archives may be monolithic systems encompassing all functions required to create, retrieve, update, and delete
electronic records across an organization, or they may be made up of multiple integrated electronic systems. This latter
architecture is particularly appropriate for large organizations which already have document management, records
management or knowledge management (“KM”) systems in-place.60


For most organizations, the ability of the electronic archive to work with existing e-mail systems will be critical. As
noted by one publication:
          … the management of e-mail is sometimes characterized as the single biggest records management problem in the
          USA. Thus, for any organization looking to implement major initiatives in the management of its electronic
          records, e-mail systems should be the initial focus of such efforts.61
Integration of e-mail can vary from simple journaling (also called “logging”) of all messages to the electronic archive, to
interactive interfacing with the client e-mail application (for example, adding record classification functions to
Microsoft Outlook). For guidance in developing policies for e-mail management and considerations for technological
solutions, see The Sedona Conference® Commentary on Email Management (August, 2007) available at:
http://www.thesedonaconference.org/content/miscFiles/Commentary_on_Email_ Management___revised_cover.pdf.
As new applications are developed or acquired within organizations, the records management requirements relative to
those applications should be anticipated and planned as part of the system development or software and/or hardware
selection. Digital preservation requires routine efforts to migrate records to overcome software and technological
obsolescence and from deteriorating media.
A well-designed electronic archive should support multiple storage media and provide mechanisms for tracking
physical write date and time stamps for a given record (that is, the system should track when a record was stored on a
given media—this is significantly different from the record creation metadata tracking when a record’s content was
initially produced).
For records with long retention requirements it may be necessary to copy records to fresh media periodically. This
process of copying to new media is referred to as “refreshing.” When should refreshed copies be made? The National
Library of Australia has concluded the best choices for long-term (over ten year) archival media and format are CD-R
media and XML data formatting.62 Regarding optical media, they note “the lifetime of optical disks of all kinds, and
especially CD-Rs, is greater than the technological obsolescence factor of their recording and playback technology.63

  The European Communities’ “Model Requirements for the Management of Electronic Records” (“MoReq”) distinguishes between a document management

Many DM/KM systems contain electronic archive (or electronic records management) functions, either as part of the base system, as add-on components or are
available through programmatic features. Where those functions do not exist for the system, it may be necessary to integrate stand-alone DM/KM and electronic
archive systems by means of a real-time or periodic transfer between the respective repositories. The development effort involved in this integration can be significant.
Both the MoReq and DoD 5015.2-STD provide useful starting points for defining integration requirements.

NARA, in combination with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), provides guidance on CD
and DVD media and formats in the NIST Special Publication 500-252, Care and Handling of CDs and DVDs—A
Guide for Librarians and Archivists (NIST October 2003). The results of NIST’s evaluations are controversial and do
not agree with manufacturer and independent testing.64 Given the significant variance among these expected life
figures, a reasonable compromise may be to use the best quality media available, maintain both on-line and off-line
media in an environmentally controlled space (stability appears more important than specific temperature and
humidity values), and plan on refreshing copies at intervals of no more than ten years.

Due to rapid technological obsolescence, organizations may wish to consider duplicating particularly valuable records
that must be kept for more that ten years to non-electronic media (e.g., computer and output microfilm or “COM;” or
archival paper).
Long-term electronic archive designs should consider incorporation of national or international specifications such as
MoReq or Open Archival Information System (OAIS). Standards such as ISO 1548965 establish guidelines for
records management policies and systems but generally fall short of specifying functional details of automated systems.
However, DoD 5015.2-STD and MoReq each contain useful information defining functional requirements for
electronic record archives. Both of these also define selected metadata elements required for an electronic records
archive. Either document would be appropriate as a starting point for acquisition or construction of an electronic
archive system. Finally, both ARMA International and the National Archives Records Administration (NARA) provide
planning and guideline documents at their respective web sites.66
Organizations designing comprehensive long-term electronic archives should consider the need for managing and
tracking electronic and non-electronic records. This may include migration from legacy systems tracking paper,
film/fiche, artifacts and electronic records.
Policies for maintenance of long-term electronic archives should address destruction and removal of records (and, as
appropriate, their metadata) including any need for forensic-level electronic deletions. Methods for obtaining approval
for destruction should be incorporated in the archive system. Electronic archives should provide disposition functions
for both logical and physical record deletions and permit specification of which, if any, associated metadata elements
should be removed.
One issue that often arises is tracking details of when and how a given record may have been removed from the
archive. In the paper world, “Certificates of Destruction” exist as proof that a set of records was destroyed by a
particular method and by a specific organization on a given date. If a need exists for similar compliance
documentation on electronic records, it will be necessary to keep a minimal set of metadata about those records to
have a “target” for the data tracking the disposition. This requirement will only exist if it is necessary to track the
disposition information on specific records. Generic statistics (for example, a count of records deleted) can be
maintained without retaining record metadata.
Policies for access to long-term electronic archives should consider requirements for ownership and control including,
but not limited to, security, traceability, authenticity, and change-control over the record lifecycle. The National
Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Concept of Operations provides useful guidelines for typical user
functions and associated ownership concerns.67 This set should not be taken as absolute: many organizations will have
only some of the roles, and some organizations will have additional roles. In particular, records management policies
may define other roles (such as “Official Record Owner”, “Records Contact”, etc.) as appropriate for a given
environment and organizational context. Finally, for electronic archives some roles, such as “Record Processor” may be
handled by automated agents (that is, by software rather than people).

Reporting functions within the electronic archive—or the equivalent facility to report against the data technology
underlying the archive (for example, to perform SQL (“Structured Query Language”) queries against an Oracle
database on which the archive was built)—should provide access to historical, transactional and current record
management metadata sufficient for auditing and verification of the archive. These tools provide the mechanisms
critical to on-going validation of archive use, policy compliance, litigation analysis and extraction, and statutory or
regulatory processing requirements.
Automated Tools68
An organization should consider whether, and to what extent, automated tools may be useful in managing the
information and records contained in its e-mail and other systems. See The Sedona Conference® Commentary on Email
Management (August, 2007) available at: http://www.thesedonaconference.org. Users of e-mail face the challenge of
dealing with many incoming and outgoing e-mail messages daily, even hourly. The life cycle of such electronic
information is often extended, not because of determined value or record-keeping requirements, but because of the
sheer quantity of material requiring some action. Software programs exist to facilitate automated management of
e-mail messages, including “janitor” programs that dispose of e-mail based on given criteria (e.g., time period
expiration—30, 60, 90 days after receipt—subject line content matches, etc.), “filtering” programs that screen content
and/or direct messages to appropriate parties for response, and “archiving” programs that copy messages to long-term
storage and provide message indexing and security functions. These tools should be viewed as reasonable information
and records management protocols with two caveats. First, the routine destruction of e-mail based on date or account
size alone, such as may occur with the use of janitor programs, can result in the loss of valuable information (e.g.,
records required to meet regulatory provisions). If janitor programs are used, care should be taken to ensure that
valuable e-mail messages are protected from the operation of the janitor program. Second, the tool must allow for the
preservation of relevant e-mails in the case of legal holds. See Guideline 5, Comment 5.e.
Should an organization always automatically suspend its e-mail management program when faced with a triggering
event such as litigation? If an organization has a function or procedure in place so that e-mails and associated
attachments relevant to litigation or investigation are identified and segregated to preserve them (whether by means of
employees segregating the information or by use of automated tools), then it need not suspend this part of its record
management program, just as it would not suspend the remainder of its program for information not subject to the
legal hold. Further, at least in federal court, one might rely on the provisions of Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(f ) (“Absent
exceptional circumstances, a court may not impose sanctions under these rules on a party for failing to provide
electronically stored information lost as a result of the routine, good-faith operation of an electronic information
system.”). However, it is important to note that the protection offered by this rule is limited. What constitutes
“exceptional circumstances” or the “routine, good-faith operation of an electronic information system” is within the
court’s discretion, as is its ability to issue sanctions under its inherent authority to supervise discovery rather than
‘”under these rules.” See also, United States v. Philip Morris USA Inc., 327 F. Supp. 2d 21, 25-26 (D.D.C. 2004)
(where 11 senior executives failed to follow internal procedures for preservation and e-mail deletion was not suspended
court barred witness from testifying at trial and imposed total sanctions of $2.75 million).

        Comment 4.g.
        An organization should recognize the importance of employee education concerning its information and
        records management program, policies and procedures.

Organizations should strive to ensure that employees understand their responsibilities for the appropriate creation, use,
retention and destruction of electronic information and records. Each of these areas in the life cycle of a record is
important, has both risks and opportunities, and should be addressed in a comprehensive education or training
program. Different organizations may rely on different techniques and means to communicate their policies and
procedures. No one method of education or training is “best” for every organization. An organization should
determine the most effective method of communicating with its employees given the nature, size and culture of the
organization, and recognizing that different personalities receive and retain information in various ways. Often,
multiple “channels” of communication, including e-mail, voice-mail, computer based training, and use of company
intranets can be helpful, though such multiple approaches are certainly not mandated.
        Illustration iii. Acme Company posts its records management policy on an internal website, along
        with a list of frequently asked questions and the names and phone numbers of persons to call with
        respect to different kinds of questions (e.g., legal, technical, tax) about retention issues on its intranet
        site. The site hosts an on-line training program where an employee answers questions about the
        policy and its implementation and can sign a certification that the employee has read and understands
        the policy.
        Illustration iv. BasicCo employs 50 individuals in one location and has found that company-wide
        meetings where policy highlights are discussed and hard copies of policies are given to each employee
        are the most effective means of communicating important information.
An organization’s training and communication about its information and records management policy and procedures
should emphasize the importance of protecting the information assets of the organization and that risks and
consequences exist when this responsibility is ignored.
Documentation of the organization’s efforts to educate and instruct employees can support the administration and
consistent application of the policy. It may also assist an organization in defending its policy in legal proceedings.

        Comment 4.h.
        An organization should consider conducting periodic compliance reviews of its information and records
        management policies and procedures, and responding to the findings of those reviews as appropriate.

When implementing a program, an organization should be clear about its expectations for individual responsibility of
employees in managing information and records. Organizations should also consider performing periodic compliance
reviews of their policies and procedures for managing information and records, and respond to those reviews as
necessary through use of appropriate sanctions for failure to comply (e.g., under-retaining, over-retaining and failing to
adhere to legal hold requirements). Cf. ISO 15489-1 §§ 10-11 (describing possible contours of training and
auditing/monitoring programs).
Monitoring compliance with the information and records management policy is not required by law, but is a matter of
sound practice. An organization can enhance its prospects for a successful retention program—and reduce its risk of
exposure—if it conducts periodic reviews and takes meaningful steps to improve compliance with the program.
Some organizations require employees to acknowledge in writing their understanding of, and responsibility for
adhering to, the organization’s policies and procedures regarding information and records management. The use of
such a procedure is highly dependent upon the organization’s culture and, although not necessary for a reasonable
policy or practice, it may be useful in certain organizations to assist with policy compliance. In any event, the
organization’s policies and procedures should also specify that policy adherence will be viewed as a component of an
individual’s job performance and that appropriate curative steps, including sanctions, may be administered if an
employee continually fails to comply.



                                                                                                                         41
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                      November 2007

The review of habits concerning information housekeeping during an annual review, or the process of a litigation
collection, may also uncover electronic “pack rats” or the improper use of the organization’s information assets. While
not part of a formal review process, some channels for feedback to those responsible for monitoring and updating the
company’s records management program can be beneficial.

        Comment 4.i.
        Policies and procedures regarding electronic management and retention should be coordinated and/or
        integrated with the organization’s policies regarding the use of property and information, including
        applicable privacy rights or obligations.

Most organizations have policies that deal with the proper use of facilities and equipment primarily, if not exclusively,
for business purposes. Any policies and procedures addressing information and records management ideally should
dovetail with such use edicts.
In addition, most organizations have policies and procedures addressing the protection of trade secrets and competitive
commercial information (such as employee non-disclosure covenants). Because much of this valuable information is
now stored electronically, the need for close integration of efforts is clear.
Furthermore, statutes addressing the privacy rights of individuals (e.g., the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, and security breach legislation in 34 states) and
their regulatory counterparts have increased the burdens on organizations to ensure that covered personal data is not
improperly disclosed. Again, since most of this data resides in electronic format, the advantages of relating (if not
marrying) corporate policies and objectives to technical and records management solutions becomes evident.
As noted earlier, see Comment 2.d, the protection of personal data in the European Union (“EU”) countries is an area
that also requires special attention. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2000/C364/01)
recognizes that each person has a right to the protection of personal data and that such data must be processed fairly,
for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person or some other legitimate lawful basis (Article 8).
Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, art. 8, 2000 O.J. (C 364) 1 (Dec. 18, 2000), available at
http://www.europarl.eu.int/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf. This right is mostly contained within Directive 95/46/EC on
Data Protection (the “Directive”) and applies to any data that identifies an individual, including name, address,
telephone number or specific physical characteristics. The collection, storage, retrieval, transmission and destruction
of data all fall within the definition of “processing” under the Directive. The majority of the obligations with respect
to personal data falls on “data controllers,” defined as those responsible for determining the purposes and means of the
processing of personal data, as distinguished from “data processors” defined as “a natural or legal person, public
authority, agency or any other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.” The Directive
establishes that data controllers must adhere to the following key rules:
    •   Personal data may only be processed as described to the data subject and with the data subject’s consent,
        unless a specified exception applies (such as when the processing is necessary for performance of a contract to
        which the data subject is party).
    •   Data subjects must be given the opportunity to rectify, erase or prevent the use of incorrect personal data.
    •   Personal data must not be kept longer than is necessary under the circumstances.
    •   Except in certain circumstances personal data may not be exported from the European Economic Area
        (“EEA”).
    •   The processing of sensitive data (race, ethnicity, political opinions, religion, trade-union membership, health
        or sexual preference) is subject to further restrictions, including the need for the data subject to give informed
        consent to the processing.
U.S. companies have been fined for providing unsatisfactory protection of personal data. For example, in 2001
Microsoft was fined approximately $60,000 by the Spanish Data Protection Agency for failing to implement sufficient
controls when it transferred employee data outside of the EU. See http://www.privacyinternational.org/survey/
phr2003/countries/spain.htm. As of the time of this publication, the EU has determined that generally the United

                                                                                                                        42
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                                                                         November 2007

States does not provide adequate protection for personal data, except for: (a) the specific provisions of the
U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor Privacy Principles; and (b) the transfer of Air Passenger Name Record69
to the United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection. See Press Release, “Commission decisions on the
adequacy of the protection of personal data in third countries” available at http://europa.eu.int/comm/justice_home/fsj/
privacy/thridcountries/ index_en.htm and attached documents, including: “Opinion 8/2004 on the information for
passengers concerning the transfer of PNR data on flights between the European Union and the United States of
America (30.9.2004)” and “Commission Decision 2000/520/EC of 26.7.2000 - O. J. L 215/7 of 25.8.2000” pursuant
to Directive 95/46 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequate protection of personal date
provided by the Safe Harbour Privacy Principles. (Last accessed 08/22/2005.) Alternatively, U.S. companies can
achieve “adequacy” for the purpose of transferring data from the EU by (a) gaining the consent of the data subject, (b)
establishing “Binding Corporate Rules” between the EU data authority and the U.S. company, and (c) entering into
contractual agreements using EU “Model Contracts” and “standard contractual clauses” (less favored by U.S.
companies because the contracts require compliance with EU data protection law.)

             Comment 4.j.
             Policies and procedures should be revised as necessary in response to changes in workforce or organizational
             structure, business practices, legal or regulatory requirements and technology.

The complexity of managing disparate and ever-changing electronic records is heightened by the fact that most
organizations themselves are dynamic—organizations grow and shrink, businesses and assets are bought and sold,
employees come and go. Policies and procedures should remain relevant and evolve with changes in legal
requirements, organizational structure, business practices and technology. The information and records management
policy should be periodically reviewed and revised as required to address changes in business processes that may affect
the organization’s information and records management practices.
From an operational and records management perspective, organizations should develop procedures to address the
disposal and/or transfer of electronic information and records in such a dynamic business and technology climate. For
example, when businesses sell information assets, knowing what should and should not be retained is critical. The
transition program should address these data ownership issues.
A more common example is where an employee leaves a particular job function or the organization. Procedures
governing what to do with electronic information and records associated with that employee will reduce risk (loss of
assets) and manage costs (storage of records without owners). One of many possible approaches is to inventory the
employee’s electronic records and to assign custody of them to the employee’s manager. The manager can then
coordinate the review, inheritance and retention of these records, as appropriate. And the manager, or delegate, can
provide the appropriate direction to the information technology department concerning the migration or other
disposition of the information.
From a legal perspective, there may be circumstances when the legal department should determine whether some or all
of the electronic information associated with certain departing employees should be retained. In developing its
policies and procedures, an organization should consider the circumstances in which the legal department’s
involvement is important and provide for mechanisms to incorporate it. It is important to coordinate the efforts of
the human resources, law and IT departments closely in these situations, to avoid unintended consequences.
An organization is ultimately responsible for managing its information and records even when it uses outside
contractors to create, manage, store and dispose of information and records. As a best practice, an organization should
carefully consider whether to apply its records retention policies to outside contractors, consultants and other third-
party providers, when they have been delegated the responsibility for the creation, management, storage and
disposition of information and records relative to those functions. Factors to consider include the extent to which the
organization has out-sourced critical business functions (e.g., Human Resources, Finance), the extent of independence

Efforts to create a new agreement were in process this summer. On October 6, 2006 the U.S. and EU struck a deal whereby the EU will “push” 34 pieces of information per passenger to
the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. DHS will “facilitate” wider distribution within the United States, replacing the previous “pull” system that allowed US-direct access to EU
passenger data. The new accord will expire at the end of July 2007. Negotiations regarding a permanent agreement are underway.

               Comment 5.a.
               An organization must recognize that suspending the normal destruction of electronic information and
               records may be necessary in certain circumstances.

An organization’s information and records management policy must recognize that certain events will impose a duty to
preserve potential evidence or otherwise justify suspending the normal course of records destruction, including the
normal procedures for disposing of electronic information and records.70 Circumstances that may require suspending
normal destruction of electronic information and records would include, among others: actual or reasonably
anticipated71 litigation; government investigation72
 or audit; preservation orders issued in active litigation; and certain business-related scenarios (e.g., mergers or
acquisitions, technology reviews, bankruptcy). In the event of such circumstances, an organization must suspend
its normal document retention procedures and preserve all relevant information (even if not of “record” quality). See
Comment 5.e; see also DaimlerChrysler Motors v. Bill Davis Racing, Inc., 2005 WL 3502172 (E.D. Mich. Dec. 22,
2005) (“Such normal procedures for destruction of documents must, however, be suspended when a party is on notice
that they may be relevant to litigation, and the failure to make an adequate search of such documents before their
destruction may be evidence of bad faith.”)

               Comment 5.b.
               An organization’s information and records management program should anticipate circumstances that will
               trigger the suspension of normal destruction procedures.

Ideally, an organization’s information and records management program should have an established process by which it
evaluates whether a duty to preserve arises as a result of actual or reasonably anticipated litigation, government
investigation or audit. Circumstances constituting such notice may include, but are not limited to: an inquiry from
the government, service of a complaint or petition commencing litigation or a third-party request for documents.

  Some courts and commentators refer to “reasonably anticipated litigation” as “threatened” litigation. The terminology employed is not as important as the concept: there must be some
specific set of facts and circumstances that would lead to a conclusion that litigation is imminent or should otherwise be expected. The mere fact that litigation regarding a topic (such as
a product or a contract) is a general possibility is ordinarily not enough to trigger preservation obligations.

  18 U.S.C. § 1519 was amended (as section 802 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, H.R. 3763) to expend criminal penalties for destroying documents with the intent to impede or obstruct a
government investigation of any matter before a U.S. department or agency.

policy in bad faith or targeted any documents with the intent to prevent production in a lawsuit).
The analysis of the need for a “legal hold” is usually done by the legal department, but it may involve other
departments as there may be a wide variety of reasons to institute hold orders (such as financial audits, compliance and
litigation matters). A recommended practice is for the legal department to have a separate checklist of circumstances
by which it considers whether a preservation obligation has been triggered and, if so, what steps need to be taken to
identify the scope of the obligation and what has to been done to meet the obligation. The exact manner in which this
is done may vary as long as there is a process by which circumstances can be evaluated to determine if there needs to be
a suspension of ordinary destruction practices.

        Comment 5.c.
        An organization should identify persons with authority to suspend normal destruction procedures and
        impose a legal hold.

Organizations need to identify a chain of command to decide when normal records retention procedures should be
suspended. Ideally, organizations can identify in advance one or more “point” persons responsible for managing this
process. Contact information should be easily accessible to employees.
An organization’s information and records management policy should provide specific direction concerning hold
notices. This generally includes: (1) who has the authority to impose a legal hold on records otherwise scheduled for
disposition; (2) who is responsible for communicating the legal hold requirements; (3) who is responsible for
implementation; and (4) who has authority to determine that the need for a legal hold no longer exists. The policy
could also provide a typical form of notice and channels for communicating when it is necessary to suspend the
normal course of records retention and destruction. Of course, the content of the notice will vary depending on the
particular circumstances. See Comment 5.e.




                                                                                                                        45
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                    November 2007

        Comment 5.d.
        An organization’s information and records management procedures should recognize and may describe the
        process for suspending normal records and information destruction and identify the individuals responsible
        for implementing a legal hold.

Once a duty to preserve is triggered and a legal hold is required, the organization needs to take steps to implement the
hold. Pre-established procedures set forth in the policy or other policy support materials can help clarify the
requirements for a reasonably diligent search to identify, locate, collect and appropriately handle relevant documents
when notice is received of actual or reasonably anticipated litigation, government investigation or audit. For all the
reasons identified in describing why a multidisciplinary team may be important to the successful launch of a retention
program, see Comment 4.c. An effective litigation response team may often include persons in the organization
responsible for oversight and administration of the information and records management policy, representatives from
the legal department (preferably with some litigation experience), representatives of the IT department, other senior
level managers or executives as may be appropriate to the matter or case, as well as sufficient staff to implement the
response.
Litigation response issues the organization may wish to address include:
            •    How are potentially responsive records and other information identified?
            •    Who is involved in the identification?
            •    Who will be contacted?
            •    Where and how will records and other information subject to the legal hold be stored?
            •    Who collects and coordinates the retention of the records and other information subject to the legal
                 hold?
            •    Whether and how to regularize and document the team process?
            •    What metadata, if any, may be material to a particular dispute and thus may need to be preserved?
            •    Whether records and other information must be “frozen” in a snapshot?
            •    Whether “point-in-time” information needs to be preserved on an ongoing basis (future snapshots),
                 and, if so, when and how will this be done?
            •    Is there a particular need to preserve legacy on backup media or systems?

    Comment 5.e.
    Legal holds and procedures should be appropriately tailored to the circumstances.

Any suspension of the normal course of information and records retention and destruction—or “legal hold”—should
be informed by legal judgment, should be tailored to the legal requirements of the case, and should apply only to the
life of the litigation, investigation, audit or other circumstances giving rise to the suspension.
The obligation to preserve evidence does not require that all electronic information be frozen. See Zubulake v.
UBS Warburg LLC, 220 F.R.D. 212, 217 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (organizations need not preserve “every shred of paper,
every e-mail or electronic document, and every back-up tape”); see also Wiginton v. Ellis, No. 02 C 6832, 2003 WL
22439865, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 27, 2003) (“A party does not have to go to ‘extraordinary measures’ to preserve all
potential evidence. … It does not have to preserve every single scrap of paper in its business.”) (citing China Ocean
Shipping (Group) Co. v. Simone Metals Inc., No. 97 C 2694, 1999 WL 966443, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 30, 1999) and
Danis v. USN Communications, Inc., No. 98 C 7482, 2000 WL 1694325, at *32 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 23, 2000)). The
scope of what is necessary to preserve will vary widely between and even within organizations depending on the nature
of the claims and the information at issue. See Zubulake, 220 F.R.D. at 218 (“In recognition of the fact that there are
many ways to manage electronic data, litigants are free to choose how this task [of retaining relevant documents] is
accomplished.”); see also The Sedona Principles, Second Edition (2007).


                                                                                                                      46
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                                                                               November 2007

Accordingly, a legal hold should be limited in scope to only that information and records that may be relevant to the
litigation. Decisions as to what should be held should be made as early in the process as practicable, and refined over
time. Legal holds should not be all-inclusive, or encompass entire bodies of information and records just because it
may be “easy” to seize the whole of a category or system. The legal hold must cover relevant electronic information
and records, and the legal hold notice should specifically state that relevant electronic information and records must be
preserved. See The Sedona Principles, Second Edition (2007), Principle No. 5. In the civil litigation discovery context,
the obligation to preserve and produce relevant evidence is generally understood to require that the producing party
exert only reasonable efforts to identify and manage the relevant information readily available to it. See Zubulake v.
UBS Warburg LLC, 220 F.R.D. 212, 217-18 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (describing how contours of preservation obligation are
defined); Fennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd., 83 F.3d 526, 532 (1st Cir. 1996) (“In determining whether material is
‘discoverable,’ the court should consider not only whether the material actually exists, but the burdens and expenses
entailed in obtaining the material.”); MANUAL FOR COMPLEX LITIGATION, § 11.446 (4th ed.) (“For the most part,
[computerized] data will reflect information generated and maintained in the ordinary course of business.”). When
the circumstances that gave rise to the hold cease to exist, the organization should determine whether the hold can be
lifted in whole or in part, in order to alleviate further costs of preservation.
In particular circumstances, implementing a legal hold may also require a change to the organization’s backup
procedures for business continuation or disaster recovery. A legal hold should address what actions, if any, are to be
taken to suspend recycling of disaster recovery backup tapes, either on a temporary or ongoing basis, pending further
litigation developments. Compare Zubulake, 220 F.R.D. at 218 (holding that “as a general rule” litigation holds do not
apply to “inaccessible” backup tapes, i.e., those maintained solely for purposes of disaster recovery, but distinguishing
backups used for information retrieval that would be subject to such holds) with Applied Telematics, Inc. v. Sprint
Communications Co., No. 94-4603, 1996 WL 33405972, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 17, 1996) (holding defendant at fault
“for not taking steps to prevent the routine deletion” of backup files); and Keir v. UnumProvident Corp., 2003 WL
21997747, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 22, 2003) (preservation obligations include backup tapes); see also The Sedona
Principles, Second Edition (2007), Comment 5.h.73
In certain circumstances, legal hold procedures may require the suspension of certain automatic deletion programs or
processes that continuously delete information without intervention (such as e-mail janitor programs). Suspension
may be necessary when the organization knows that the program or process will lead to the loss of relevant records or
other relevant information that is not otherwise preserved or available. Of course, if adequate policies and procedures
are in place to preserve relevant information, there may be no need to alter the standard operating practices of the
business (such as e-mail janitor programs).
             Illustration i. Under its records management policy and procedures, a company requires that its
             employees limit the quantity of electronic information that is stored, or limit the time that
             communications that do not constitute records of the organization can remain, in the employees’
             respective active e-mail accounts. Upon commencement of litigation, adequate steps are taken to
             inform the pertinent individuals to save relevant e-mail currently and in the future. The organization
             is not required to alter the policy, provided that the legal hold procedures are communicated and
             effective to preserve the relevant documents.
For examples of discussions of the various legal hold or preservation “scope” issues that have been identified in the case
law, see Crandall v. City of Denver, 2006 WL 2683754 at *2 (D. Colo. Sept.19, 2006) (“Mere existence of a document
[in this case e-mail] destruction policy within a corporate entity, coupled with a failure to put a comprehensive “hold”
on that policy once the corporate entity becomes aware of litigation, does not suffice to justify a sanction absent some

  When required to preserve backup tapes, an organization may elect to preserve a reasonable subset of previously created backup tapes (i.e., keeping some combination of existing
incremental, weekly or monthly backups), without in every case needing to indefinitely suspend the further recycling of backups. See Zubulake, 220 F.R.D. at 218 (“[i]f a company can
identify where particular employee documents are stored on backup tapes, then the tapes storing the documents of ‘key players’ to the existing or threatened litigation should be
preserved” if the information is not otherwise available). Cf. E*Trade Secs. LLC v. Deutsche Bank AG, 230 F.R.D. 582, 592 (D. Minn. 2005) (because party “relied on its backup tapes to
preserve evidence that was not preserved through a litigation hold, [the party] should have retained a copy of relevant backup tapes because it was the sole source of relevant evidence”).

        Comment 5.f.
        Effectively communicating notice of a legal hold should be an essential component of an organization’s
        information and records management program.

Once events occur requiring that a legal hold be imposed, court decisions make clear that the notice should be
communicated to appropriate custodians of affected records and individuals who may have other relevant information.
Courts have identified the following factors as significant, so an organization imposing a legal hold should evaluate:


    •   The person providing the notice. Courts have repeatedly stated that document retention issues are significant
        matters for corporations and organizations and there must be sufficient attention and resources devoted to
        meeting preservation duties in light of the circumstances. See Danis v. USN Communications, Inc., No. 98 C
        7482, 2000 WL 1694325, at *39-41 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 23, 2000). In large organizations with thousands of
        employees, it should be sufficient that the notice come from senior representatives of the legal department or
        some other department charged with the responsibility for preserving records for the organization. Cf. In re
        Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. Sales Practices Litig., 169 F.R.D. 598, 612, 615-16 (D.N.J. 1997) (found that
        defendants’ earlier preservation hold notices were inadequate and required senior management to advise
        employees of the pending litigation, provide them with a copy of the court order and inform them of their
        potential civil or criminal liability for noncompliance).
                                                                                                                     48
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                                                                                   November 2007

       •     The contents or scope of the notice. The notice need not be, and most likely should not be, a detailed catalog
             of documents to be retained, but instead should provide a sufficient description of the subject matter of the
             documents to be preserved that would allow the affected document custodians to segregate and preserve
             identified information and records. See Wiginton v. Ellis, No. 02 C 6832, 2003 WL 22439865, at *5 (N.D.
             Ill. Oct. 27, 2003) (initial notice sent to employees to preserve documents only pertaining to the one named
             plaintiff in a putative class action addressing employment issues was insufficient as it did not properly reflect
             scope of preservation obligation; broader revised notice was sufficient).74
The means and extent of communicating the records hold. The notice does not need to reach all employees in the
organization, only those necessary to preserve relevant information and records. The communication need not be
disseminated beyond the scope of reasonable inquiry absent specific information and knowledge that requires
otherwise. The notice should be communicated through means likely to reach the intended audience, and may
include electronic and/or paper distribution. See United Medical Supply Co., Inc. v. United States, 77 Fed. Cl. 257 (Fed.
Cl. 2007) (spoliation found where notice failed to reach relevant custodians due to incorrect e-mail addresses and
attorney failed to follow up when no responses were received); In re NTL, Inc. Sec. Litig., 2007 WL 241344 (S.D.N.Y.
Jan. 30, 2007) (many employees did not receive legal hold notice, and those that did were not made aware of their
continuing preservation obligations); Consol. Aluminum Corp. v. Alcoa, Inc., 2006 WL 2583308 (M.D. La. July 19,
2006) (defendant’s initial litigation hold did not include a sufficient number of employees, and the process failed to

             Illustration ii. Under its policy, a potential producing party enlists the assistance of its employees or
             agents who are identified as possibly having relevant information by informing them of the nature of
             the controversy and the time frame involved, and by providing them with a method of accumulating
             and updating (where disputes are ongoing) copies of the relevant information. The appropriate
             individuals are instructed to preserve relevant information for the duration of the controversy and
             steps are established to follow up with the identified individuals and secure the information. The
             organization has likely fulfilled its obligations.
             • Whether notice should be sent to third parties. Consideration should be given to sending the
             notice of the legal hold to third parties if such third parties possess documents or data that effectively
             are in the possession, custody or control of the producing party.
             • Updated notices. Consideration should be given as to whether notices of the legal hold should be
             updated as the litigation proceeds (e.g., where new parties or claims are added or eliminated). Care
             must be given, however, to ensure appropriate consistent direction among all preservation notices. In
             certain circumstances, organizations may want to consider repeating notices or periodic general
             reminders that employees need to adhere to previously issued legal holds. Cf. Zubulake v.
             UBS Warburg LLC, 229 F.R.D. 442 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (recommending periodic re-issuing of litigation
             hold notices). But it is important to make sure that repeat notices are effective and that necessary
             follow-up or modification occurs. See United Medical Supply Co., Inc. v. United States, 77 Fed. Cl. 257
             (Fed.Cl. 2007) (follow up notices were sent to same incorrect e-mail addresses as original notices and
             no follow-up occurred to ensure notice had been received and was being followed).

   This aspect of the Wiginton case is troubling for it uses a subsequent remedial measure (a more precise preservation notice) as evidence that the first notice was insufficient. Wiginton v.
Ellis, No. 02 C 6832, 2003 WL 22439865, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 27, 2003); cf. Consol. Aluminum Corp. v. Alcoa, Inc., 2006 WL 2583308 (M.D. La. July 19, 2006)(court found that
subsequent notice, after receipt of initial discovery requests, to more employees than in the original notice was still insufficient because the hold should have included even more
employees).

The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                                                                           November 2007

      Comment 5.g.
      Documenting the steps taken to implement a legal hold may be beneficial.

Organizations should consider ways in which the legal hold process—either generally or in a given case— is recorded.
This should usually include a copy of any legal hold notice(s) that have been issued, and a distribution list for the
notice(s).75 Some organizations may wish to create checklists which outline the steps taken from the point of notice
through the decision to release a legal hold. Such documents may assist in the development of affidavits or testimony
which might be required should the preservation process be challenged. Some organizations require employees to
certify receipt of, and compliance with, legal hold instructions. Other organizations rely on the legal hold notice
combined with other steps, such as witness interviews, to ensure appropriate preservation steps have been taken.
Regardless of the steps taken, a record of compliance can be very useful in defending any challenges to the
organization’s good faith efforts to meets its preservation obligations. Cf. Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC, 229 F.R.D.
442 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (noting roles of counsel and client in implementing legal hold notices and procedures).
Conversely, an inability to provide this information in conjunction with a failure to produce all relevant information
could be damaging. See Pioneer Res. Corp. v. Nami Res.Co., LLC, 2006 WL 1635651 (E.D. Ky. June 8, 2006) (court
ordered defendant to provide written documentation of its efforts to locate e-mail messages defendant claimed it could
not find, noting failure to do so could result in sanctions).
Although documenting preservation efforts is a recommended practice, there is no legal requirement mandating the
creation of such a “paper trail.” Likewise, the absence of such documentation in a particular instance or organization
should not be viewed as evidence that the organization did not act in good faith or that its efforts were not sufficient to
meet its legal obligations.

             Comment 5.h.
             If an organization takes reasonable steps in good faith to implement a legal hold, it should not be held
             responsible for the acts of an individual acting outside the scope of authority and/or in a manner
             inconsistent with the legal hold notice.

As noted elsewhere, courts have imposed severe sanctions on organizations that have been found to have allowed the
spoliation of evidence by either reckless or intentional conduct attributed to the organization. See United States v.
Philip Morris USA Inc., 327 F. Supp. 2d 21, 25-26 (D.D.C. 2004) (where 11 senior executives failed to follow internal
procedures for preservation, court barred witness from testifying at trial and imposed total sanctions of $2.75 million);
GE Harris Railway Electronics, LLC v. Westinghouse Air Brake Co., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16329, 2004 WL 1854198
(D. Del. Aug. 18, 2004) (adverse inference and contempt finding warrant $1.8 million fine); Kucala Enters., Ltd. v.
Auto Wax Co. Inc., No. 02 C 1403, 2003 WL 21230605, at *8 (N.D. Ill. May 27, 2003). Some courts have stated
that negligent conduct may be sufficient to warrant sanctions in certain circumstances. See Residential Funding
Corp. v. DeGeorge Fin. Corp., 306 F.3d 99 (2nd Cir. 2002). These courts have not, however, explicitly described how a
party’s good faith and reasonable efforts to implement legal hold procedures may insulate it from liability for the
spoliation of evidence by employees who have failed to follow the organization’s policies and directives. Compare
Convolve, Inc. v. Compaq Computer Corp., 223 F.R.D. 162, 177 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (declining to impose sanctions where
failure to preserve was not intentional, and declining to require preservation of “ephemeral” information where to do
so would require heroic efforts far beyond the regular course of business) with In re Adelphia Communications Corp.,
327 B.R. 175, 180 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2005) (“Thus the court is constrained to disagree with the Creditors’
Committee’s broad statement, citing to page 2134 of the [Supreme Court Reporter’s publication of the Arthur
Andersen decision], that Arthur Andersen ‘makes clear that a company may not be convicted where the wrongdoing is
not international and pervasive, and that the acts of a few cannot be imputed to a corporation that otherwise lacks
criminal intent.’ Arthur Andersen makes clear that wrongdoing must be intentional, but that is as far as it goes.”).

  Organizations should consider whether they intend to produce legal hold notices during discovery, keeping in mind that although legal holds may be withheld under privilege or work
product protection even if relevant, such notices must be included on a timely and complete privilege log in order to maintain protection. See Gibson v. Ford Motor Co., 2007 WL 41954
(N.D. Ga. Jan 4, 2007) (legal hold notices protected by attorney-client privilege); Capitano v. Ford Motor Co., 2007 WL 586586 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Feb. 27, 2007) (legal hold notices subject
to work-product protection); Kingsway Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP, 2006 WL 1520227 (S.D.N.Y. June 1, 2006) (legal hold notices relevant but privileged so long as
they are included on a proper and timely privilege log).

                                                                                                                                                                                    50
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                      November 2007

The recognition of the availability of a “safe harbor” against culpability in such circumstances is essential, and the 2006
Amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure may provide some limited safe protection for the loss of
information through the routine, good faith operation of computer systems. The Advisory Committee notes make
clear that an organization’s efforts to impose a legal hold should be considered in determining “good faith.” See Report
of the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to the Committee on Rules of Practice and
Procedure of the Judicial Conference of the United States, at 125-29 (May 27, 2005; rev. ed. July 25, 2005), available
at www.uscourts.gov. As is abundantly clear from the body of this document, the nature and volume of electronic
documents is such that there is no possibility that any preservation system can be perfect. See Comments 1.b and 1.c,
see also Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC, 220 F.R.D. 212, 217 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (“Must a corporation, upon recognizing
the threat of litigation, preserve every shred of paper, every e-mail or electronic document, and every backup tape?
The answer is clearly, ‘no.’ Such a rule would cripple large corporations, like UBS, that are almost always involved in
litigation.”); Wiginton v. Ellis, No. 02 C 6832, 2003 WL 22439865, at *4, *7 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 27, 2003) (organization
“does not have to preserve every single scrap of paper in its business”; “CBRE did not have the duty to preserve every
single piece of electronic data in the entire company.”). In addition, economic incentives for the creation of reasonable
and effective litigation hold procedures will be eroded if there is no benefit absent a guarantee that the process will be
perfect.
Consistent with the legal authority examined in this document, although no court has expressly so ruled, the Working
Group believes that if an organization takes reasonable and good faith steps to ensure that relevant information is
preserved, but an employee engages in conduct inconsistent with the organization’s directions (express and implied), it
may be appropriate to hold the individual, but not the organization, responsible provided that the organization can
demonstrate it applied and enforced its policy and did not condone or adopt the actions of the employee. See In re
Adelphia Communications Corp., 327 B.R. at 180 (in rejecting Creditors’ Committee for a broad interpretation of the
Arthur Andersen decision to insulate corporations from criminal liability for acts of a limited number of employees
when the corporation lacks criminal intent, court nevertheless noted that the proposition advanced by the Creditors’
Committee “… may be what the law already is, and may be what the law should be …”). At a minimum, if the
organization took reasonable steps in good faith to preserve evidence, the organization should not be found to have
engaged in “willful” misconduct. Courts should examine the specific facts and circumstances of each case before
determining that an organization should be held responsible for spoliation despite the implementation in good faith of
a demonstrable and reasonable “legal hold” process.

        Comment 5.i.
        Legal holds are exceptions to ordinary retention practices and when the exigency underlying the hold no
        longer exists (i.e., there is no continuing duty to preserve the information), organizations are free to lift the
        legal hold.

An organization’s policy and procedures can explain not only who in the organization has authority for determining
that the need for a legal hold no longer exists, but also what factors or information should be considered, and what
procedures should be followed, to remove the legal hold. Considerations may include:
    •        The form and content of notice that the legal hold has been lifted;
    •        Whether there is a post-case obligation to maintain some records or other information pursuant to
             normal retention schedules or otherwise;
    •        Whether the records or other information that can now be destroyed, are subject to another legal hold, or
             may be needed for another special purpose (e.g., needed in whole or in part for other litigation);
    •        Whether the underlying litigation that has been resolved gives rise to the reasonable anticipation of other
             similar litigation;
    •        Whether records or information in third-party custody can be destroyed; and
    •        Whether the records or other information can be disposed of as soon as the legal hold is lifted, or whether
             the organization should wait until the next scheduled disposition.


                                                                                                                        51

An organization’s information and records management policy should be based on an accurate and complete
understanding of the sources and types of electronically stored information generated, received and used within the
organization, as well as an overall assessment of the practices in place regarding the use, retention, storage, preservation
and destruction of records generally. During this assessment, the organization should review its current information
and records management program: how information and records are created and maintained; how record disposition
decisions are made and implemented; and how information and records critical to the organization are protected.

                                                                                                                         63

        Specifically, the organization should plan to gather information on its:
              •   Size, structure, locations, industry;
              •   Regulatory requirements for record-keeping;
              •   Current records management policies and procedures;
              •   Information systems infrastructure; and
              •   Methods for ensuring compliance with policies and procedures.
Many models for such record-keeping surveys exist, but no one template can be taken as a talisman for
every organization. This Appendix provides a sample that can be used as a starting point by organizations addressing
records management issues, with particular emphasis on electronically stored information. Note, however, that this
survey is not exhaustive and an organization should consult with individuals equipped to assist in a comprehensive
review of records management programs and policies. Other samples that may also be useful as a guide in creating a
customized assessment tool include:

For organizations that wish to assess their records management, particularly in comparison to the requirements in
ISO 15489-1, ARMA International has developed an online assessment tool. It is a high level (rather than in-depth)
assessment, but will be valuable in the initial stages of program assessment or development. More information on this
assessment product (RIM e-Assessment) can be found on the ARMA website (www.arma.org/standards).


        I.        Investigate the company’s current state of information and records management

                                                                                                                               64
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                     November 2007

        B.      Determine operational and regulatory factors
                        1.        What are the business or legal considerations that drive record-keeping?
                        2.      How does the nature of the business affect the creation and management of
                        information
                                that is vital to business functions?
                        3.        How does the industry in which the business operates affect the kind of information
                        that
                                  the business must retain for legal reasons?
                        4.        Does the company belong to any industry or trade organizations, or have another
                                  designation, which imposes certain guidelines, standards or requirements?
                        5.       Does the company’s specific structure, needs, legal duties or other considerations
                        require that document management policies for electronic records be distinguished from
                        those used for paper records?
        III.    Evaluate the Current State Documentation
        A.      Records management policy

                1.      Is it written?

                2.      Is it contained in a single document?

                3.      Is it clear?

                4.      Is it well distributed and easily accessible?

                5.      What is the scope of the policy?

                6.      Does it apply to all kinds of information? (i.e., paper, e-mail, word processing documents,
                        spreadsheets, databases, voice mail, instant messaging)

                7.      Does it apply globally?

                8.      Does it apply to subsidiaries and affiliates?

                9.      Does it apply to records in the possession of contractors, outside counsel, etc.?

                10.     Does it apply to all information, whether stored on site or offsite?

        B.      Records retention schedules

                1.      Who has authority to create or modify schedules?

                        2.        What is the process for creating or modifying schedules?
                        3.        How are the schedules organized (by business, by function, by topic, etc.)?
                        4.        Do the retention schedules distinguish certain types of information as “records” and
                                  other types of information as something other than “records”?
                        5.        Do the retention schedules apply regardless of storage medium? (paper, electronic,
                                  microfilm, CD, file server, etc.)
                        6.        Are there “conditional” retention schedules (i.e., triggered by a future event)?
                                  (e.g., “Life

                                                                                                                       65
                                  of system” or “3 years after termination of employment”)
The Sedona Guidelines Second Edition                                                                  November 2007

                        7.      If an employee is uncertain what retention category applies to a record, what is the
                                mechanism for that employee to seek clarification, and for the organization to
                                rovide an answer?
                        8.      Has the organization addressed the retention of e-mail messages, voice-mail message,
                                instant messages and other electronic communication tools?
                        9.      Are retention times binding policy, recommendations, guidance, etc.?
                        10.     If the retention times are mandatory, how is compliance verified? (Audits? Written
                                certification? Other?)
                        11.     How does the organization publish records retention schedules or otherwise
                                ommunicate them to employees?
                        12.     How does the organization communicate schedules to non-U.S. employees?
                        13.     If the schedules apply globally, how does the organization deal with local
                                requirements?
        C.      Assess consistency of documentation

                1.      Is the records management policy consistent with the records retention schedules and any
                        information technology policies?

                2.      Are the training materials and any other guidance given to employees consistent with the
                        policies and schedules?

        IV.     Review how the organization implements its retention policy
        A.      Does the organization provide guidance on:
                        1.      What records are to be created.
                        2.      What format should be used to capture “original” records, status of drafts, working
                                papers and reference copies of records.
                        3.      The status of shadowed or deleted information.
                B.      Evaluate how the organization currently manages the disposal of records
                        1.      Determine to what extent the organization relies on each individual to dispose
                                of/destroy electronic records?
                        2.      How does the organization educate employees about records
                                retention/disposition/destruction responsibilities?
                        3.      How does disposition/destruction occur?
                        4.      What disposal/destruction methods are authorized or required? Is there a difference
                                between paper and electronic?
                        5.      When is information considered “destroyed” within the organization? Is this true for
                                all types/categories of information?
                                a.      When the “delete” button is pushed (i.e., free space pointers are adjusted)
                                b.      When the media has been overwritten? (how many times?)
                                c.      When the media have been physically destroyed?
                                d.      When backups have been overwritten? (how many times?)
                                e.      When an audit log or similar mechanism has been checked, and all copies
                                        have been destroyed?

                                                                                                                      66

                C.      Determine if records are being preserved for the required retention period
                        1.       How does the organization ensure that records will remain accessible, readable, and
                                 usable throughout their scheduled retention?
                        2.       When records are copied from one medium to another (such as scanning paper
                                 records onto optical disk, microfilming, or moving to another system), does the
                                 organization retain the originals?
                        3.       Are there appropriate controls in place to address the:
                                 a.       life span of the storage medium (e.g., disk or tape decays over time)?
                                 b.       obsolescence of software (e.g., moving to a new word processing program)?
                                 c.       obsolescence of hardware (e.g., mainframe systems)?
                                 d.       obsolescence of the storage medium (e.g., 5.25” disks)?
                                 e.       backup media (e.g., tapes) from a records retention perspective?
        V.      Evaluate the organization’s ability to effectively manage records over their entire lifecycle
        A.      Estimate records volume
                        1.       Is the volume of paper records increasing, decreasing or stable?
                        2.       What is the volume of electronically stored information on the company’s systems?
                                 What are the anticipated increases over the next 1, 3, 5 years?
                        3.       How is the volume of paper records managed? For example, does the organization
                                 use in-house storage centers, commercial third-party records storage facilities or
                                 other solutions?
                        4.       How is historical electronically stored information managed? Does the organization
                                 retain information in-house, through third-party servers or vendors, or in another
                                 manner? Where is the information map showing what information is where?
                B.      Evaluate the organization’s information services/technology (“IT”) function including:
                        1.       All hardware used for organization-wide systems (i.e., mainframes, mini computers,
                                 e-mail servers, file servers, fax servers, voice-mail servers?)
                        2.       All operating systems (e.g., Windows NT/2000/XP, Linux, Novell, Unix,
                                 proprietary?)
                        3.       All desktop hardware and software, including:
                                 a.       office document programs (e.g., word processing, spreadsheet programs)
                                 b.       internet browsers
                                 c.       electronic mail
                                 d.       calendar/scheduling
                                 e.       database management programs
                                 f.       industry-specific applications
                                 g.       finance or accounting systems
                                 h.       remote connection applications
                                 i.       instant mail or “chat” programs
                        4.       All data storage locations available to users (e.g., local hard drives, network drive

                         13.      What principles govern decisions as to the scope (years and varieties) of records that
                                  must be held?
                         14.      Are suspended records held in the normal work area or sent elsewhere?
                         15.      When the suspension ends and normal disposal can resume, how is that
                                  communicated?
                         16.      What is done with records retained during a suspension once the suspension period
                                  has ended?
         Once completed, the survey data can be used to develop a new or updated information and records
management policy that addresses the specific needs of the organization. The survey results are also likely to identify
those areas of the organization where gaps exist between current record-keeping methods and records management best
practices.
          Resolving these gaps usually requires the development of supporting procedures, guidelines and directives to
address specific records life cycle matters. It will also require technological initiatives to incorporate records
management requirements into existing and planned business systems. An action plan that prioritizes these additional
activities should be developed so that improvements in record-keeping practices address those shortfalls that expose the
organization to unnecessary legal or operational risks.

        Appendix E: The Sedona Conference® Working Group Series
                                & WGSSM Membership Program




“
                            The Sedona Conference® Working Group Series (“WGSSM”) represents the
                            evolution of The Sedona Conference® from a forum for advanced dialogue to an
                            open think-tank confronting some of the most challenging issues faced by our
                            legal system today.

                            The WGSSM begins with the same high caliber of participants as our regular
                            season conferences. The total, active group, however, is limited to 30-35 instead
                            of 60. Further, in lieu of finished papers being posted on the website in advance
DIALOGUE                    of the Conference, thought pieces and other ideas are exchanged ahead of time,
                            and the Working Group meeting becomes the opportunity to create a set of
DESIGNED                    recommendations, guidelines or other position piece designed to be of immediate
TO MOVE                     benefit to the bench and bar, and to move the law forward in a reasoned and just
                            way. Working Group output, when complete, is then put through a peer review




       „
THE LAW                     process, including where possible critique at one of our regular season
                            conferences, hopefully resulting in authoritative, meaningful and balanced final
FORWARD                     papers for publication and distribution.

IN A                        The first Working Group was convened in October 2002, and was dedicated to
                            the development of guidelines for electronic document retention and production.
REASONED                    The impact of its first (draft) publication—The Sedona Principles; Best Practices
                            Recommendations and Principles Addressing Electronic Document Production
AND JUST                    (March 2003 version)—was immediate and substantial. The Principles was cited
                            in the Judicial Conference of the United State Advisory Committee on Civil
WAY                         Rules Discovery Subcommittee Report on Electronic Discovery less than a month
                            after the publication of the “public comment” draft, and was cited in a seminal e-
                            discovery decision of the Federal District Court in New York less than a month
                            after that. As noted in the June 2003 issue of Pike & Fischer’s Digital Discovery
                            and E-Evidence, “The Principles...influence is already becoming evident.”

                            The WGSsm Membership Program was established to provide a vehicle to allow
                            any interested jurist, attorney, academic or consultant to participate in Working
                            Group activities. Membership provides access to advance drafts of Working
                            Group output with the opportunity for early input, and to a Bulletin Board
                            where reference materials are posted and current news and other matters of
                            interest can be discussed. Members may also indicate their willingness to
                            volunteer for special Project Team assignment, and a Member’s Roster is included
                            in Working Group publications.

                            We currently have active Working Groups in the areas of 1) electronic document
                            retention and production; 2) protective orders, confidentiality, and public access;
                            3) the role of economics in antitrust; 4) the intersection of the patent and
                            antitrust laws; (5) Markman hearings and claim construction; (6) international e-
                            information disclosure and management issues; and (7) e-discovery in Canadian
                            civil litigation. See the “Working Group Series” area of our website
                            www.thesedonaconference.com for further details on our Working Group Series
                            and the Membership Program.
