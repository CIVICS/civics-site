                                       FOREWORD




        City and town government in Massachusetts has given the Commonwealth a proud
heritage. Throughout its history Massachusetts local government has performed vital functions in
the safeguarding of citizens’ constitutional rights, the protection of persons and property, the
regulation of business and utilities, the performance of public works, the maintenance of public
solvency, and the provision of health, educational, social and recreational services. The
knowledge and awareness of this heritage will be ensured by the preservation of the records that
document it. The professional management of the local government records of the
Commonwealth will safeguard that information which is vital to administrative efficiency, fiscal
accountability, the legal rights of citizens and, by no means least, the local history of the
Commonwealth. It is to that end that this Municipal Records Retention Manual is dedicated.
        The professional staff of my office has produced the Manual as a guide for local records
custodians in the maintenance of records under their care. The Manual contains advice and
guidance in the development of programs of records management in its major components: the
organization of records including the inventorying and appraisal of records; the disposal of
records which have become valueless and obsolete; the protection and security of records by
means of fire-resistive equipment and procedures to safeguard records against theft and
vandalism; and the conservation of records in order to ensure the longevity of the physical
integrity of permanent or archival records.
        It is my pleasure to present to the cities and towns this Manual. Its use will assist the
cities and towns in the twin goals of improving management by improving records management,
and preserving the vital information of our historic past.

                     REVISIONS TO THE CURRENT EDITION



        This revision of the schedule reflects an effort by the Records Management Unit to
simplify the process of municipal records management. Certain schedules were combined, and
many had series moved to the updated and expanded Administration, Personnel and Records in
Common schedule. If you are unable to find a record series once located in a particular schedule,
please refer to the Records in Common Schedule, as it will likely be located there.
        An appendix that contains copies of relevant bulletins issued by the Supervisor of
Records has been added. Additionally, there is now a listing of all records series sorted by
retention period.
       Please contact the Records Management Unit if you have specific questions regarding
your schedule.
        A note about the Open Meeting Law (OML). The new OML became effective July 1,
2010, and may be found at MGL c. 30A, §§ 18-25. Revisions to this schedule have been made
to reflect new record creation and retention requirements. Please see the Records In Common
Schedule (01.070-01.081) for more information.
        The new section sets retention requirements for records created by public bodies subject
to the OML. Such public bodies may also create records that are not reflected in this section, and
should refer to other sections of this schedule for retention requirements regarding those other
records.

                          Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

WHAT IS A PUBLIC RECORD?
The term “public records” is broadly defined to include “books, papers, maps, photographs, recorded
tapes, financial statements, statistical tabulations, or other documentary materials or data, regardless
of physical form or characteristics, made or received by any” public employee. For a complete
definition, see MGL c. 4, § 7 (26).
WHAT IS A HISTORICAL RECORD?
Records created prior to 1870 are considered to be historical records and may not be destroyed.
CAN MUNICIPAL RECORDS BE STORED AT THE STATE ARCHIVES?
The State Archives is the repository of records that document the activities of state agencies only.
Municipalities are responsible for the management, storage, and security of their records pursuant to
MGL, c. 66, known as the Public Records Law.
HOW CAN I DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF CUBIC FEET OF MY RECORDS?
A standard file cabinet drawer is the equivalent of two cubic feet. For more information, see the
Cubic Feet Equivalency Chart in this book.
MUST I SHRED RECORDS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR DESTRUCTION?
There is no statutory requirement to burn, shred, or pulverize obsolete records. However, there is
nothing that prevents you from shredding records provided you have obtained written authorization
to dispose of obsolete records from the Supervisor of Records. Government entities are advised to
treat the destruction of personal information with great caution.
WHAT IS RECORDS DISPOSITION?
Disposition is the regular and rational process by which records are removed from the office when
they are no longer active.
MAY I RECYCLE RECORDS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR DESTRUCTION?
Such records may be recycled provided you have obtained written authorization to dispose of
obsolete records from the Supervisor of Records.
HOW DO I KNOW IF A RECORD IS PUBLIC?
You may contact the Public Records Division for more information on how to determine whether a
record is exempt from public access:

                       Introduction and Historical Overview
Introduction
        Many factors have contributed to the dramatic increase in the volume of records output
by government offices. As government expands and becomes more complex, so does the
creation, maintenance, and preservation of records. The science of records management includes
creation, maintenance, and preservation and seeks to assist records custodians in the maintenance
and disposal of records.
       What is “records management?” It is an administrative plan or function in which records
are logically categorized or arranged for easy retrieval, use, and destruction. Where there is
records management, there are systematic procedures for the creation, utilization, and disposition
of records. These procedures facilitate the rapid and economic retrieval of data for the
administration of any organization. The objectives in managing records are to make the records
serve the purpose for which they were created as cheaply and effectively as possible, and to
make proper disposition of them after they have served their purpose.
Historical Overview
        The history of records management services for local government in the Commonwealth
may be traced back to an 1884 resolve by the General Court calling for a report on public
records. This resulted in the temporary position of a commissioner who surveyed conditions and
inventoried records throughout the state. The report, written by Carroll D. Wright, published in
1889, listed records, examined records-keeping techniques, and made specific recommendations
for improvement.
       The original 1884 resolve was extended in 1889 and led to the issuance of further reports,
the creation of a permanent position of Commissioner of Public Records, and the passage of
Chapter 333 of 1892. This act was the basis of what has become the current Public Records Law.
        The first permanent Commissioner of Public Records was Robert T. Swan, who
continued the work Wright had started. Commissioner Swan issued annual reports and
established what may have been a firm basis of future concern for public documents.
        With the passage of Chapter 3450 of the Acts of 1919, the public records function was
relocated in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth. At the same time, the position of
Supervisor of Records was created, but the responsibilities for examining the care and custody of
public records in towns ceased to have the importance they had under Commissioners Wright
and Swan.
        In the 1970s, the importance of the state’s role in applying active supervision and
providing technical assistance to local government records was at last recognized. By 1974, a
local records program was instituted in the Division of Public Records with the creation of a
team of records analysts.
       The Records Management Team (RMT) undertook a survey of the main business offices
in the cities and towns and developed a series of records retention/disposition schedules for
municipal departments. By 1978, the RMT had surveyed all 351 municipalities, assessing
organization and security, and recommending and requiring proper methods for the arrangement,


                                               13
storage, preservation, and disposal of municipal records. From 1978 to 1982, follow-up surveys
were conducted with a view toward gauging the performance of municipalities in meeting the
requirements and recommendations of the initial survey and toward making further
recommendations regarding immediate records management needs.
       Analysis of the six-year program has shown that there has been a marked improvement in
the organization and security of local public records. A large number of cities and towns had
constructed new vaults or up-graded existing ones, or acquired class-rated safes and fire-resistive
cabinets. Some municipalities restored the physical integrity of their older historical records by
undertaking conservation programs. Others have inventoried their records, a vital step in the
development of progressive management policies.
Supervisor of Records; On-Going Services
        Although improvements in the management of records across the Commonwealth have
been impressive, there remains much room for further advances. The Secretary of the
Commonwealth recognizes the need to place competent, professional help at the disposal of local
records custodians, and the need to promote a close working relationship with local government
in the development of records management programs. In the early 1980s, the Secretary
transferred the RMT, known today as the Records Management Unit (RMU), to the Archives
Division with a view toward pooling the expertise of records managers and archivists. In this
manner, a more informed and effective service can be provided to all agencies of the
Commonwealth. The RMU is now a separate section of the Archives Division and continues to
carry out the record management responsibilities of the Supervisor of Records.
       To assist cities and towns in the establishment of their own records management
programs, the Supervisor has authorized the publication of this Municipal Records Retention
Manual. The Manual includes sections on records organization, records disposition, security, and
conservation. The Manual is intended to serve as both encouragement to municipalities to carry
out their responsibilities under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 66 and a stimulus for
thought and discussion on how records management practices can be improved. It is hoped that
records custodians find it a useful, informative, and effective tool in facilitating the vital tasks of
government.




                                                  14
                                Inventory and Appraisal
Inventory
        The basis of any records management program is effective reference and security control
of records. The means to establish this control is a thorough records inventory. With the
completion of an inventory, the custodian will have definite knowledge of the types of records
held, their inclusive dates, volume, the type of information they contain and the location of the
records. Once the inventory has been compiled, an annual updating will keep the inventory
current. Thenceforth, the inventory can be used in conjunction with the applicable retention
schedules to ensure that:
       (a) Departmental records are safely stored and readily available;
       (b) Long-term records are preserved;
       (c) Obsolete records are disposed of properly.
        The first step is to appoint a records officer. This person may be the department head, or
in the case of larger offices embracing several divisions, a records coordinator. In the case of
multi-division offices, representatives from each division should be included in the planning
stage of the inventory so that the program can be explained and understood. See, MGL c. 66, § 6
(all governmental entities must appoint a custodian of records).
       In conducting the inventory, current records should be examined before non-current
records since officials will be more familiar with them. It is important that all records are
inventoried; none should be overlooked because of their seeming unimportance or
disorganization.
        The inventory should proceed in a systematic manner, with information immediately and
clearly recorded on a worksheet. Separate worksheets should be completed for every records
series. A record series may be defined as a set of records organized or filed in accordance with a
single filing system. For example, general correspondence organized in a series of alphabetically
arranged folders constitutes a records series. Separate worksheets should also be completed for
parts of a single record series found in different locations.
        After completing an inventory of the records, worksheets may be arranged alphabetically
by title of records series, by location, or in a more complex fashion based on a classification of
the records by type. Photocopying the forms will allow for multiple approaches to the
organization of the worksheets.
        The following inventory worksheet may be useful since it clearly identifies the types of
information being sought. Instructions for its use follow and explain the procedures for
identifying and describing records.
Appraisal
       With the completion of a records inventory, custodians move on to the next step in their
records program, that of appraisal. The appraisal of records is one of the most significant steps in
a records program, as it is the point at which definitive judgments are made about the enduring
values of records. These judgments will lead to decisions on the retention of the records.



                                                15
       First, consult the retention schedules. If the records series in question is listed, then the
custodian need only take action based upon the prescribed retention period. Records the retention
period of which has expired may be disposed of in accordance with the procedures listed in this
Manual.
        If the records series in question is not listed on the schedule, then the custodian should be
prepared to appraise the material. The appraisal process should be performed by those persons
directly responsible for the creation and use of the records. The assistance of the Supervisor of
Records or the RMU may be sought as needed.
      During appraisal, records possessing one or more of the following values will have
recommendations to be preserved permanently, or for a period of time until an event, or until a
combination of an event and a time period.
       1. Administrative Value
       A record possesses administrative value if it helps the office perform essential functions
       now or in the future. The custodian should ask, “At what point in time will this record
       cease to be of potential administrative value? Is this administrative value found in any
       other records which will be retained?”
       2. Legal value
       A record possesses legal value if it documents a legal right or obligation of a citizen, of
       the office or of the municipality. A record will lose that value at the point in time when
       that legal right ceases, or ceases to be enforceable under current law. The official should
       ask, “At what point in time will this record, or records series, cease to document any
       enforceable legal rights? Are these rights documented by any other records which will be
       retained?”
       3. Fiscal Value
       A record possesses fiscal value if it uniquely documents or verifies the spending or
       receipt of public monies. Many records lose fiscal value at the point in time when they
       are audited. The official should ask, “At what point in time will this record, or records
       series, no longer be needed to document the transfer or payment or encumbrance or other
       action pertaining to the sending or receipt of public monies? Is that information
       documented in another record which may be more appropriate to keep?”
        When municipal officials have completed their appraisal of a records series based on the
foregoing criteria, there still remains one more value to be sought in the records. Consultation
with the Supervisor of Records may be particularly appropriate in testing for this value, which
can be the most subjective value to verify through the appraisal process.
       4. Historical Value
       The application of this value is fundamentally a search in the records series for possible
       cultural values to posterity. Does the records series provide valuable information on
       persons, events, or subjects? Does the series provide valuable information on the key
       operations of a significant municipal office? Generally, records that document the


                                                 16
       operation, procedures, policies, or organization of municipal government or contain
       significant factual information will possess historical value. This value, however, also
       must be tested against such other considerations as the uniqueness of the records, the
       volume (and consequent preservation and storage costs) of the records, the importance of
       the information, the accessibility of the information (in light of the volume or
       understandability or format of the material) and the likelihood that the material will
       actually be used by future historians or other researchers.
       In addition, it is essential to note that state law (MGL, c. 66, § 8) establishes that no
       public record created prior to 1870 may be destroyed. All such records are considered to
       have historical value requiring their permanent retention.
        Records series may have no significance under any of these values, or they may be
established which will satisfy the longest retention period required under any of the values.
Permanently valuable records series should be retained under appropriate conditions to ensure
their long-term preservation. They should be well identified, available to researchers and given
proper preservation treatment (including possible microfilming). Records series with limited
retention periods that have not yet been satisfied should receive appropriate care in the interim.
Those records should be disposed of at the end of that period. Those records series that can be
immediately disposed of should be dealt with in a manner consistent with the procedures set
forth in the Manual chapter on Records Disposition.

                             Instructions for the Use of Records Inventory Worksheet

1. Department, Division, Section: This information places the records in their organizational setting. Some
   departments will have no divisional or sectional breakdowns.

2. Title of records series: The series title should be as specific and descriptive as possible. General terms, such as
   “reports,” “requisitions,” or “correspondence” should be avoided. Examination of the appropriate departmental
   retention schedules will give examples of various record series titles. For clarity in applying these schedules, the
   same titles should be used whenever possible.

3. Description of records series: This provision is for information on content, purpose, function, creation, use
   and other information that will clarify the type of data included in the records series.

4. Location of records: The location should be given as exactly as possible – including the room, file cabinet,
   shelf, etc. Use separate worksheets for parts of a records series that are found in different locations.

5. Earliest date/latest date: The earliest and latest dates of the records.
6. Volume: Measure how much space the records occupy. Use cubic feet as the measure of volume. (See cubic
   foot equivalency chart in appendix to this section.)

7. Annual accumulation: The volume of records created annually.
8. Arrangement: Explain how the various records in the series are arranged, whether alphabetically by folder
   headings, chronologically, numerically, or by some other system.

9. Size of records: The width, height, and in cases of bound volumes, thickness.
10. Format of records: Are the records handwritten, typewritten, or on magnetic tape, audio tape, etc.?_
11. Reference frequency: How often are the records consulted?_ This information is important for establishing the
    proper retention period for the series.

12. Information available elsewhere: Is the same information found in other records series?_ This is also important
    for establishing the proper retention period for the series.

13. Microfilmed: Have the records been microfilmed?_ If so, what portion of them?_ What type of microfilm?_
14. Indexed: Have the records been indexed?_ Indicate indexing identification.
15. How stored: Identify the types of storage equipment that are used to hold the records.
16. Condition of records: Are the records in good or poor condition?_ Explain any problem in their condition, i.e.,
    mold, acid degeneration, discoloration, water damage, brittleness, insect or rodent infestation or damage, etc.

17. Records on retention schedule: Have the records already been schedule for retention/disposition purposes?_ If
    not, the individual completing the worksheet should suggest such a retention period (permanent, destroy after
    five years, destroy after audit, etc.) and provide a justification for the suggested period. This is not the finial
    retention period that will be established, but only a suggestion based on immediate impressions – a suggestion
    subject to later revisions.

18. Condition of storage area: Is the storage area in good or poor condition?_ What problems exist (e.g., lack of
    security, no alarms, not fireproof, high temperature, low humidity, dirt, etc.)?_

19. Additional comments: This provision is for any additional comments that the person completing the work-
    sheet wishes to make. Any important information not noted on the worksheet?_ Any significant research or
    historical value to the records or parts of them?_

20. Name of person completing worksheet; date of inventory: These provisions are self-explanatory.

                                                                                                                    RMUIW 12/21/10
                                    Records Disposition
Advantages
        Once records have been inventoried and appraised and a sound, intellectual control has
been established over records holdings, it is then possible to develop systematic procedures for
the disposal of records that have become obsolete.
        The disposal of records in accordance with state records retention schedules will result in
the removal of large quantities of obsolete records from among the many records series in each
municipal office. The freeing of space and attendant staff time to service records will contribute
to significant savings. The savings can be considered annually, as municipal offices will never
again be required to maintain those records on which disposal procedures have been enacted. So
long as schedules are regularly implemented, the re-accumulation of such records will be
prevented.
       A well thought out program of records retention and disposition will:
       (a) Ensure that records are kept as long as they are required;
       (b) Result in the destruction of obsolete material;
       (c) Facilitate the rapid retrieval of information;
       (d) Clear space for more productive use and prevent the accumulation of unnecessary
           records;
       (e) Eliminate potential fire hazards caused by the clutter and over-crowding of obsolete
           records;
       (f) Effect cost savings by freeing floor space, reducing staff time required to service
           records and eliminating the need to purchase additional filing equipment to house
           useless records.
Procedures
       In Massachusetts, all government offices are required to obtain authorization before
destroying records. Chapter 66, Section 8 of the General Laws provides for the preservation of
the records of the commonwealth, counties, cities, and towns and expressly prohibits the
destruction of any records “without the written approval of the Supervisor of Public Records.”
        In order to establish a policy for the consistent disposition of local government records,
the Supervisor has authorized retention schedules for municipal departments. Each schedule
contains a list of the records created or maintained by an office; statutory citations to help clarify
the identity of records; and the minimum time period for which records must be retained.
Instruction sheets and sample disposal request letters are attached to the front of each schedule.
The essential procedure is to submit to the Supervisor a letter (in duplicate) citing the records to
be disposed, the inclusive dates of the record, and overall estimated volume to be destroyed.
After review for correctness, the Supervisor shall return one approved copy of this letter.

            SELECTED SUPERVISOR OF RECORDS BULLETINS



On the following pages, you will find copies of selected bulletins issued by the Supervisor of
Records. For a complete list of Supervisor of Records Bulletins, please visit our Web site at:

                            SPR Bulletin 4-96
         Fees for Access and Copying of Electronic Public Records
TO: Public Records Custodians
SUBJECT: Fees for Access and Copying of Electronic Public Records
EXPIRATION DATE: Until superseded
PURPOSE: This bulletin provides guidance to custodians on how to compute the applicable fees for copying and
accessing electronic records

BACKGROUND:

The Public Records Law clearly applies to the disclosure of electronic records. The computer enhances
government’s ability to provide information in various formats not available on paper. Additionally, the computer
enables the custodian to merge files or manipulate data in order to create new records. The government is entitled to
charge certain costs associated with compliance with requests for data in magnetic media.

FINDINGS:

The term “public records” is broadly defined to include all documentary materials or data, regardless of physical
form or characteristics, made or received by any officer or employee of any municipality or agency of the
Commonwealth, unless falling within a statutory exemption. G. L. c.4, § 7(26)(a-m) (1994 ed.). Therefore, the
Public Records Law clearly applies to government records generated, received, or maintained electronically.

Public records, and any non-exempt, segregable portions thereof, are subject to mandatory disclosure upon request
and upon payment of a reasonable fee. Accordingly, a custodian may withhold exempt information within a record
but must disclose any public portions. A custodian may recover costs incurred when complying with public records
requests, including costs associated with searching for the record and segregating any exempt information.
Segregation may be accomplished by blocking out exempt information on a copy of the record, or through electronic
segregation prior to disclosure.

ACTIONS:

1. Unless otherwise established by statute, a records custodian may charge no more than the following fees for
copies of public records: twenty cents ($.20) a page for photocopies, twenty-five cents ($.25) for copies maintained
on microfilm or microfiche, fifty cents ($.50) a page for computer printout copies and for copies of records not
susceptible to ordinary means of reproduction (such as oversized documents, audio tapes and computer tapes), the
actual cost incurred may be assessed. When the cost of complying with a public records request is expected to
exceed ten dollars ($10.00), the records custodian shall provide the requester with a written, good faith estimate of
the costs involved.

2. The Public Records Access Regulations (Regulations) also allow a record custodian to assess a fee for a search of
computerized records based on the actual cost incurred from the use of the computer. 950 CMR 32.06(1)(e). The
only such “actual costs” which may be recovered are: the cost of the energy consumed during use, the materials
used, and the prorated salary of the computer operator. Minimum fees may not be imposed for the inspection, or
copying, of a public record.

3. There is no basis in the Public Records Law or Regulations for recovering the costs incurred in developing the
database or entering information. These costs are incurred by a custodian in the daily operations of the office and are
not the direct result of complying with a request for public records. Therefore, such costs cannot be passed along to
a requester.




                                                         101
4. A custodian has a duty to write a program to segregate exempt information from non-exempt computerized
information. See G. L. c.66, §10 (1994 ed.) (custodial duty to segregate). Again, only the actual costs incurred may
be assessed for compliance.

5. In certain instances, the reprogramming necessary to comply with a request in a specific format is tantamount to
creating a document, rather than segregating an existing record. A record holder’s duty to comply with requests for
information extends only to records that are in existence and in his custody. There is no obligation to create a record
in response to a public records request. Since the newly created record is not within the statutory definition of
“public records,” the Regulations do not apply and the custodian may assess any reasonable fee for such
reprogramming to create a document.

6. Requests for on-line access to records or for a subscription service to certain information constitute prospective
requests. Since those records are not yet in existence at the time of the request, they are also outside the purview of
the Regulations and the custodian may set the fee for such access.

7. A custodian may be reimbursed only once for the cost of the programming necessary to comply with a public
records request. Once a program is written, a custodian may not recover the cost of writing the program each time
that program is used. Rather, that program becomes part of the municipality’s files and the custodian may assess
only the cost of reproducing the particular record.

8. A custodian may require payment of the fee prior to complying with a public records request. See 950 CMR
32.05(6) (requester is entitled to one copy of a public record or any desired portion of a public record upon payment
of a reasonable fee).

                                            SPR Bulletin 1-99
                                             Electronic Mail
TO: Public Records Custodians
SUBJECT: Electronic mail
EXPIRATION DATE: Until superseded
PURPOSE: This bulletin supersedes SPR Bulletin No. 5-92 and provides information and requirements for the
management and disposition of electronic mail sent and received by public officials.

BACKGROUND:

Electronic mail (email) is a document created, transmitted and received by a computer system or other electronic
form of written communication. Like the telephone, email allows instant communication. Like traditional mail, it
creates a durable written record of messages delivered and received. Email use has grown rapidly and it has emerged
as a major means for both communication and business activities in all segments of society.

Messages sent by email vary in substance and content. It may contain formal or informal data and text used
supporting or executing business activities and policy decisions. The growth of email and the importance of the
messages it carries, make it imperative that government offices take steps to effectively manage and control this
medium.

FINDINGS:

1. For the purpose of this bulletin, email is defined as any message created and received on an electronic mail
system. An electronic mail system is a service that provides facilities for creating messages, transmitting them
through a network and displaying them on a recipient’s computer terminal. The email message may be text or word
processing documents, spreadsheets or other data compilations transmitted through such a system.

2. All email created or received by an employee of a government unit is a public record. In Massachusetts, the term
“public record” is broadly defined to include all documentary materials or data created or received by any officer or
employee of any governmental unit, regardless of physical form or characteristics. G. L. c. 4, § 7(26). Email is,
therefore, a public record and it is subject to the requirements of the Public Records Law. G. L. c. 66.

3. All email messages are subject to public access and disclosure through the provisions of the Public Records Law.
G. L. c. 66, § 10.

4. All email messages may be sought and obtained through the discovery process in litigation and may be admissible
as evidence in a court of law.

5. In most cases, simply deleting a message does not actually ‘delete’ the message. The “delete” key merely removes
the electronic pointers to the file. The actual file may remain on the computer system indefinitely unless it is
properly expunged from the system. Questions regarding that process should be addressed to your systems
administrator. Copies of messages may also be retained independently on system backups. Regardless of the intent
to delete the message, as long as it exists, it continues to be subject to discovery.

6. Although email is analogous to paper correspondence, the courts have found that there are indeed, differences
between the two records. The contextual data (the “envelope” that contains the mailing address, date/time stamp,
routing instructions and transmission and receipt information) that accompanies email messages constitutes an
integral part of the record and thus must be retained as a part of any printed or stored version of the record.
Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 810 F.Supp. 335 (D.D.C. 1993).




                                                         103
7. Email systems are a corporate resource. Email systems in use in government offices are government property
installed and maintained for the conduct of government business. The office may and should exercise control over
the use of the resource by employees and has the right to monitor and read employee email.

ACTIONS:

1. Any employee or officer of the Commonwealth who creates or receives an email message must review said
message for content. Once a determination has been made regarding the subject matter involved in the
communication, the employee or officer must consult the retention schedules for his\her agency or municipality in
order to determine the lifecycle of that particular record. Necessary and proper records management procedures
must then be implemented to ensure that the record is preserved for the proscribed retention period. G. L. c. 4, §
7(26)(a-m).

2. Email must be managed as a part of the office’s records holdings. Email messages are subject to the same records
management principles as all other records of the office. Records retention schedules issued by the Supervisor of
Public Records (for local governments) and by the Records Conservation Board (for state government offices) must
be implemented for email as well as for analogous paper records.

3. Email systems are not record-keeping systems. All email users must screen and evaluate email messages
according to “CONTENT.”

4. Once the CONTENT or subject matter of the message is determined, the user must consult their agency’s record
retention schedule and the Statewide Disposition Schedule (for State Agencies) or the Records In Common Schedule
(for municipalities) to determine how long the record must be preserved.

5. Once the applicable retention period has been determined, the user should print out the email message and file it
in accordance with the entity’s paper filing system procedures.

6. Email messages which are too large to print or do not print accurately should be stored electronically, again
depending upon content and retention period. These messages should be saved to the office’s electronic record-
keeping system. Please consult your agency’s Record Liaison officer, computer technical people or your systems
engineer for assistance in this regard.

7. All government offices must establish written policies regarding their email systems. Said policies must ensure
that their system is capable of displaying and preserving the contextual data (metadata) associated with the email
message to ensure the capture and preservation of a complete record. Any email message which is printed to
preserve content must contain the metadata in its complete form.

8. Government offices must ensure that all personnel who will be handling email are properly trained to insure
compliance with this policy.

                             SPR Bulletin 3-96
   Application of the Public Records Law to Electronic Records Access
TO: Public Records Custodians
SUBJECT: Application of the Public Records Law to Electronic Records Access
EXPIRATION DATE: Until superseded
PURPOSE: This bulletin provides guidance to records custodians on their duties and obligations to respond to requests
for information in a computer medium

BACKGROUND:

Freedom of information laws give life to the rights of free speech and meaningful electoral participation by providing a
mechanism for holding government accountable. The computer generally enhances the government’s ability to collect,
compile, manipulate and disseminate information. Certainly, as the manner in which government information is
maintained evolves, the means of accessing such information must experience a parallel evolution to preserve a
meaningful right of access. Limiting the public’s rights of access to only paper records at a time when the government is
using a far more efficient means of reviewing information, is an effective denial of this right to meaningful access.

FINDINGS:

The term “public records” is broadly defined to include all documentary materials or data, regardless of physical form or
characteristics, made or received by any officer or employee of any city, town, or agency of the Commonwealth, unless
falling within a statutory exemption. G. L. c.4, § 7(26)(a-m) (1994 ed.) (emphasis added.). A literal reading of this statute
necessarily leads to the conclusion that the availability of information in the custody of Massachusetts governmental
entities is dependent upon the substance of the information, rather than the form in which it is maintained. This means
that records created or maintained on a computer are subject to the disclosure requirements of the Public Records Law.

Many cities and towns do not have the ability to maintain advanced computer capabilities. Therefore, in order to
maximize efficiency, several municipalities have contracted with private companies to computerize and maintain various
city and town records. There is nothing in the Public Records Law which prohibits a city or town from engaging in such
a relationship. See G. L. c.66, §10 (1994 ed.) (Public Records Law). However, the records do not become the private
property of the company. Moreover, the municipality cannot contract away its public records duties. Consequently, a
provision in the contract between the municipality and the private computer company prohibiting the dissemination of
information cannot serve as a basis for non-disclosure in response to a public records request.

ACTIONS:

1. Obligations of the legal custodian. Under the Public Records Law, the government records custodian who creates or
receives records in his capacity as a government official is primarily responsible for providing access to its records. This
legal custodian cannot, consequently, insist that a requester seek access from the service bureau within the agency
(government MIS department, data processing division, etc.) or outside the government operation (private company).
The legal custodian of the records is obligated to obtain requested records from that service bureau and provide access to
them upon request.

2. Records not yet in existence. A record holder’s duty to comply with requests for information extends only to records
that are in existence and in his custody. There is no obligation to create a record in response to a public records request.
G. L. c.66, §10(a) (1994 ed.). Accordingly, a government agency, or a private company acting in its behalf, would not be
obligated to create programs which essentially produce a new record in response to a public records request. This does
not mean that the agency cannot write such programs; only that it is not required to do so. The writing of such new
programs by, or on behalf of, the government agency, is considered the creation of a record and is done outside the realm
of the Public Records Law. Therefore, as long as there is a requester who is willing to pay for this programming to create
a new record, the government agency may establish whatever fee it deems appropriate. However, that fee may only be
assessed once. Once the government agency is in possession of that newly designed program, the records generated
thereby are subject to mandatory disclosure upon request. G. L. c.4, §7(26) (1994 ed.). Additionally, once the program is
in existence, the municipality may only charge fees in accordance with the Public Records Law.




                                                            105
3. Segregation. Public records, and nay non-exempt, segregable portions thereof, are subject to mandatory disclosure
upon request. It is the burden of the record custodian to demonstrate the application of an exemption in order to withhold
a requested record. Therefore, a custodian is obligated to segregate exempt information from that which is public and
provide an independent public record. G. L. c.66, §10(a) (1994 ed.) (custodial duty to segregate). Segregation must also
be accomplished when responding to requests for electronic records. Computer segregation may involve programming. If
compliance involves writing a program to segregate information, then the custodian must do so. Writing a program to
manipulate data or combine data from various sources so that the end product is truly a new record is not required, but as
stated above, is permissible.

4. Prospective requests. Requests for electronic records which are prospective in nature, such as an on-line subscription
or monthly updates of information, will not be subject to the Public Records Access Regulations since the request is
actually for a record not yet in existence. Such a request exceeds the purview of the Public Records Law, therefore the
custodian is able to set her own reasonable fees for compliance.

5. Software. A custodian is not obligated to provide copies of a computer program. A computer program in and of itself
is a tool used in the processing of data rather than a “record,” and therefore is not subject to mandatory disclosure.

6. Format and medium. A custodian is not obligated to provide information in a format or medium which is compatible
to every requester. That is, if a custodian is able to provide information in a compatible format or medium, then he or she
is obligated to do so. However, the burden is not on the custodian to convert data to be compatible with the requester’s
system. A records custodian must provide the information in whatever format it is capable of generating. The requester is
then responsible for converting the data into the desired format.

                                 SPR Bulletin 1-96
                   Backing up and Archiving of Electronic Records
TO: Public Records Custodians
SUBJECT: Backing up and Archiving of Electronic Records
EXPIRATION DATE: Until superseded
PURPOSE: This bulletin provides guidance for the protection and storage of public records in electronic format
through the use of back ups and archiving.

BACKGROUND:

Government information created and maintained by electronic systems is an important public resource. Proper
administration of this information entails protecting it from a variety of hazards, and preserving portions of it for
future reference and use. Two different, although frequently confused, methods are used to secure these ends.

Good business practice requires that security copies or backups of electronic records be made periodically to guard
against data loss. Backup generally entails the copying of the entire system content to disk or tape for off-site
storage. The frequency of the back up is determined by business needs but is generally on a weekly or daily basis.
Since these copies are designed to protect against business interruption, they are generally overwritten and reused
once that need is past.

Because the backups contain the undifferentiated system content, however, they should not be used for longer-term
off-line data storage. Such use is an uneconomic use of media and puts data at risk of inadvertent loss since the
backup is, by definition, destined for erasure. Where off-line data storage is needed, data should be archived to
dedicated disk or tape libraries, allowing for easy identification and retrieval of information.

FINDINGS:

Backups of electronic media are security copies the creation, retention and reuse of which are mandated by the
business needs of the organization. The content, organization, and intended use of backups does not render them
desirable as a medium for prolonged off-line storage of data.

Backup and archiving requirements apply to all computer environments, but will be implemented by different
personnel depending on the environment. In a mainframe or network environment, systems and network
administrators will implement backup and archiving. In a PC environment, implementation must be at the level of
the individual user.

ACTIONS:

1. Offices should implement policies governing the backing up and archiving of information in electronic media
specifying frequency of backup, and identifying those records to be archived.

2. As copies, rather than original records, data on backup tapes and disks may be erased, overwritten or otherwise
destroyed without the permission of the Supervisor of Public Records or the Records Conservation Board. Backups
need not and will not be included on disposal schedules approved by the Supervisor or the Records Conservation
Board.

3. Off-line storage of data should be to dedicated archive disks and tapes. Standard practices for identification and
retrieval of archived data should be implemented.

4. Archive disks and tapes constitute original records and must be listed on records disposal schedules approved by
the Supervisor of Public Records or the Records Conservation Board. Information contained in these records may
not be destroyed without the permission of the Supervisor of Public Records or the Records Conservation Board.

                                           Minutes of Meetings
TO: Public Records Custodians
SUBJECT: Minutes of Meetings
EXPIRATION DATE: Until superseded
PURPOSE: This bulletin provides information and requirements for the management and provision of meeting
minutes kept pursuant to the Open Meetings Law and the Massachusetts Public Records Law.

BACKGROUND:

One of the fundamental principles of a democracy is to maintain the transparency of governmental actions. To this
end, the Legislature enacted the Open Meeting Law and the Massachusetts Public Records Law, to ensure that the
workings of the government are open and accessible to the taxpayers and public at large. It would be contrary to the
intent of the Open Meeting Law, the Public Records Law and the foundations of a democratic system to place
impediments on citizen access to minutes of open meetings.

FINDINGS:

1. Governmental bodies are required to keep accurate written minutes of all of their meetings. G. L. c. 66, § 5A.

2. It is consistent with the underlying policy behind both the Open Meeting Law and the Public Records Law that
these minutes must be made readily accessible to the public. See G. L. c. 39, § 23B; G. L. c. 66, § 10(a).

3. While a records custodian may assess a fee for the provision of public records, the fee charged should not serve as
a deterrent for the requestor to access public records. See Globe Newspaper Co. v. Boston Retirement Bd., 388
Mass. 427, 436 (1983).

4. It is vital that a complete, accurate, and durable record be created of public meetings. Please be advised that
minutes of meetings must be maintained in a manner that ensures permanent retention of the records. If a records
custodian requires retention assistance, the Records Management Unit provides records management services and
outreach to all state agencies and municipalities to help them meet state record-keeping standards and requirements.

ACTIONS:

1. Public records that are of great interest to a large number of people must be readily available within the office of
the records custodian. These records include minutes of local board meetings, town meeting documents, warrants,
street lists, municipal financial documents, etc.

2. As required by the Open Meeting Law, minutes of meetings should be reviewed regularly and be accessible by
the public without delay. This is especially the case when dealing with executive session minutes. Once the reason
for calling the executive session has ended, those minutes must be reviewed and made available to the public. It
would be improper for a records custodian to pass along the costs associated with reviewing minutes to a records
requestor when the records custodian has a pre-existing statutory duty to perform this review. See G. L. c. 39, § 23B.

3. Minutes of meetings should be provided without delay at a minimum cost, if any. This Office encourages records
custodians to waive fees associated with the provision of meeting minutes given that disclosure is incontrovertibly in
the public interest.

      Requirement to Maintain Minutes of Meetings in Written Format
TO: Public Records Custodians
SUBJECT: Requirement to Maintain Minutes of Meetings in Written Format
EXPIRATION DATE: Until superseded
PURPOSE: This bulletin provides guidance and requirements for the creation, management, and retention of
minutes of the meetings of governmental bodies.

BACKGROUND:

Minutes of the meetings of governmental bodies constitute an invaluable record of the formulation and
implementation of public policy and the conduct of the public’s business generally. Because of their importance, all
minutes of governmental bodies have been designated as permanent records by the Supervisor of Public Records for
local government records, and by the Records Conservation Board for records of the executive branch (pursuant to
G. L. c. 66, § 8, and c. 30, § 42, respectively).

Increasingly, governmental bodies are recording their meetings on audio tapes. This is a good and sound practice.
The audio tapes of meetings are a valuable aide memoir for the creation of the final minutes of the meetings.
However, audio record tape, like other magnetic media, is not durable; magnetic media are fragile and not
appropriate for long-term storage of data.

These media are extremely susceptible to the effects of heat and humidity with distortion of the medium and
potential data loss at temperatures above 125*F (such temperatures can be reached in a closed, parked car in the
summer) and at moisture levels in excess of 50% r.h. Environmental contaminants, routine handling, and magnetic
field generators (computers, high-speed motors such as those in elevators, etc.) can result in data loss. Magnetic
media deteriorate rapidly and must be recopied at 5 to 10 year intervals.

FINDINGS:

It is crucial that a complete, accurate, and durable record be created of these meetings, and that records are protected
and preserved permanently. Therefore, to ensure their preservation, the Supervisor of Public Records requires that
the minutes of governmental bodies be recorded in written format using specified paper and inks. See G. L. c. 66, §§
56 (1990 ed.) (mandating the retention of written meeting minutes and noting which items must be reflected in such
minutes); G. L. c. 66, §§ 34 (1990 ed.) (requiring the use of rag or bond paper and state approved ink).

ACTIONS:

1. Minutes of the meetings of governmental bodies must be created in written format using specified paper and inks.
See G. L. c. 66, §§ 34 (1990 ed.); Executive Order 293 (mandating the use of permanent paper for executive branch
records and publications of enduring value).

2. Once the minutes have been written and accepted by the board or commission, audio tapes used to prepare
minutes may be erased or rerecorded without the prior permission of the Supervisor of Public Records for local
government records, or the Records Conservation Board for records of the executive branch (pursuant to G. L. c. 66,
§ 8, and c. 30, § 42, respectively), provided that there is no outstanding public records request or litigation involving
the tapes.

3. All meeting records, whether existing in the form of stenographic or longhand notes, or audio or video format, are
public records at the moment of their creation. See G. L. c. 4, § 7(26) (1990 ed.) (defining “public records” to
include all data in whatever form made by public officials). Therefore, meeting records, with the exception of
executive session records, are subject to mandatory disclosure upon request. See G. L. c. 39, § 23B (1990 ed.); G. L.
c. 34, § 34, § 9G (1990 ed.); G. L. c. 30A, § 11A 1/2 (1990 ed.) (respectively providing that minutes of municipal,
county, and state executive sessions are not subject to immediate mandatory disclosure).

Recording Material for Permanent Paper Records Requirement to Use
                  Archival Paper and Archival Ink

(This Bulletin supersedes SPR Bulletin 2-93 and SPR Bulletin 5-94.)
TO: Public Records Custodians
SUBJECT: Recording Material for Permanent Paper Records Requirement to Use Archival Paper and
Archival Ink
EXPIRATION DATE: Until superseded
PURPOSE: This bulletin provides guidance and the requirements for the use of archival quality paper and ink for
the recording of textual information of enduring value and permanent paper records.
BACKGROUND:
Our Government has a fundamental obligation to record information concerning its operation, policies and
procedures. It has a duty to preserve for the public good, the records and publications by which this information is
documented. In the past, much of the information regarding these activities has been recorded on paper containing
destructive acids. Extensive research has proven that the acid present in most writing and printing paper as well as
non-archival quality inks produced since the mid-nineteenth century has drastically reduced the life of public
records, archives, books and other paper-based documents.
FINDINGS:
The Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts issued Executive Order No. 293 on December 31, 1990,
mandating the use of permanent paper for records of “enduring value.” (N.B. Only the original, official record or
required original copies of the record as mandated by the Record Conservation Board or this office, must comply
with this standard. Subsequent, non-original copies of the record, whether certified or not do not need to conform to
this standard.)
Records and publications of enduring value are defined as those that should be permanently preserved because of
their historical significance. Such records include but are not limited to Executive Orders, annual reports, and
minutes of public meetings as defined by chapter thirty-A and chapter 66 of the Massachusetts General Laws, and
birth, death, and marriage certificates.
The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard Z39.48-1984 is the benchmark for the specification of
permanent paper. The Federal Joint Committee on Printing (JCP) has reviewed the requirements for permanent
paper extensively. The JCP has agreed on several types of permanent paper that meet or exceed the ANSI standards.
1). JCP-A270 is more stringent than the ANSI standard in some of its durability requirements and is the
recommended permanent paper standard for the Federal Government.
2). JCP A560 and JCP O-560. JCP A560 is the alkaline-based version of JCP A60, an offset book paper widely used
for general printing, and JCP O-560 is the first JCP standard for alkaline-based xerographic paper for use in copiers
and laser printers.
3) Finally, as a third option, the International Standards Organization (ISO) has developed a standard for permanent
paper. This standard is known as ISO 9706:1994. For more information on this standard, visit the website
www.iso.org.
Permanent paper having any of these designations is acceptable by Commonwealth agencies and municipalities.
Papers meeting these standards are readily available at costs comparable to ordinary office paper.
There are many implements available for creating records. (i.e., pens, typewriters, laser printers etc.) Not all of these
implements are appropriate for creating documents of enduring value and permanent records. Certain inks and
toners may have chemical properties that cause them to fade, smudge, or have a deleterious effect on paper. Inkjets
printers do not provide lasting contact between ink and paper and felt tip markers are not encouraged.
The Supervisor of Records is authorized to set standards for the media to be used in the creation of public records
and to secure their preservation. (see: G. L. c. 66, § 1, 3-4). The Supervisor of Records is responsible for
administering the provisions of Executive Order No. 293.



                                                          113
ACTIONS:
The following recommended “Best Practices” should be employed in this endeavor:
Permanent Paper:
1. All official, original records and publications of enduring value should be recorded on archival quality, permanent
paper.
2. Record custodians should refer to their respective disposition schedule to identify those records that are
considered to be permanent or of enduring value and the number of original, official copies that must be retained. If
a record series is not listed on a disposal schedule, custodians should consult with the Records Conservation Board
for state government records and the Records Management Unit for local government records for assistance in
scheduling the records. Until records are scheduled, they should be recorded on permanent paper using permanent
ink.
3. The requirement to use permanent paper also applies to blank forms purchased from vendors. Where forms are
used to create records of enduring value, the custodian must ensure that those forms are printed on permanent paper.
4. The State Library has been statutorily designated as the depository library for Massachusetts state publications.
Each state agency is required to furnish the state library with eight copies of its publications for permanent
preservation. (see: G. L. c. 6, § 39A-39B) Because these copies are considered to be of enduring value, they must be
printed on permanent paper, whether or not the remainder of the issue is printed on permanent paper.
Permanent Ink:
1. In creating permanent written records, custodians shall use recording materials i.e., ink, toner, etc. that meet the
following performance standards.
A. Lightfastness. Ink shall show no appreciable change when exposed to light, in a test comparable to the Fade-
ometer test, for 24 hours. Black inks that contain carbon do not fade, and are preferable for permanent records.
B. Water resistance. Ink shall demonstrate high water resistance ability of the image to resist deformation or change
in color with immersion in water. No obvious effects shall be seen when test strips are immersed in water and
various chemicals for 1/2 hour.
C. Alkalinity. Ink should have a neutral or slightly alkaline pH (7.0-8.5) to prevent damage to either the paper or the
writing implement.
D. Fluidity. Liquid ink shall produce good line continuity without splitting, excessive deposits of ink on the paper or
writing tip, variations of lines width and intensity, agglomerates of undispersed pigment or other undesirable writing
characteristics. Liquid ink shall not feather or spread. It shall not penetrate to the reverse side of the paper or legibly
transfer to another sheet of paper.
E. Reproduction: All colors shall be capable of reproduction by microfilming, and black ink shall be capable of
reproduction by thermography, dry copying or direct-image offset processes.
F. Xerographic Toners. Liquid toners for xerographic reproductions have been found to be more suitable for archival
applications than dry toners as the liquid toner is absorbed into the paper fiber. When copies are being created for
long term or permanent retention they should be created on xerographic machines using the liquid toner process.

                              Designation of Records Custodian
TO: Public Records Custodians
SUBJECT: Designation of Records Custodian
EXPIRATION DATE: Until superseded
PURPOSE: This bulletin defines the term custodian as it applies to public records, and provides guidance for
providing access to and ensuring the security of government records.

BACKGROUND:

It is the responsibility of government officers who create, receive and maintain public records to ensure their
safekeeping and availability to the public. Access to public records ensures public involvement, and participation
and provides a mechanism for holding government accountable for its decisions and actions. Custodial
responsibilities are governed by the Public Records Law and complementary Public Records Access Regulations.

FINDINGS:

Custody of public records is in the office that creates, receives or maintains the records for use. Each officer in
charge of a government office or department is the custodian of the records held by that office or department and has
the primary responsibility for ensuring the safety of the records, providing access to those records and ensuring their
authenticity. Where an office, board or commission does not have a clerk designated by law, it is required to appoint
a clerk to keep its record books and to designate an employee to have custody of its other public records. G. L. c.66,
§6 (1994 ed.). These responsibilities are inherent in the office and cannot be delegated or contracted to another
entity.

In some cases, public records are not maintained with the officers who created them or those that are primarily
responsible for their use and maintenance. These records may be in the care of a records center, a central file room, a
data processing department, a private contractor providing government services, a private information services
vendor, or another government officer who has agreed to care for the records. In all these cases, the entity
maintaining the records is acting as an agent of the record custodian, providing only for the physical care of the
record, and may not take action with respect to the records without the specific authority of the custodian.

ACTIONS:

1. Access to public records is through the custodian. Contractors, records centers, data processing departments,
vendors or other entities which may have physical care of public records must make those records available when
directed by the records custodian.

2. Security of public records is the responsibility of the records custodian. Where records are in the physical care of
entities other than the custodian, the custodian shall make ample provision by contract, memorandum of
understanding, or other means to ensure that the security of the records is ensured.

3. The records custodian is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of all information in the records in his custody,
and must take all precautions to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the records.

4. The records custodian is responsible for ensuring that where disclosure of certain records is prohibited by law,
those statutory mandates are observed.

5. Disposition of records is on the authority of the custodian only. Records may not be destroyed or otherwise
disposed of without the specific authorization of the records custodian and the Supervisor of Public Records.

TO: Public Records Custodians
SUBJECT: Recording Material for Permanent Public Records
EXPIRATION DATE: Until superseded
PURPOSE: This bulletin provides guidance and requirements for recording material used in the creation of
permanent public records.

BACKGROUND:

There are many implements i.e., pens, typewriters, laser printers etc. available for use in creating records. Each uses
a recording material, such as ink or toner, that is compatible with the specific appliance. Not all of these recording
materials are appropriate for creating documents of enduring value. Inks and toners may have chemical properties
that cause them to fade, smudge, or have a deleterious effect on paper. It is the responsibility of government officials
of the commonwealth to provide access to records and to insure their continued existence for future generations.

FINDINGS:

The Supervisor of Public Records is responsible for establishing standards for recording material used in the
creation of permanent public records (See MGL chapter 66, section 4).

ACTIONS:

1. In creating permanent records, custodians shall use permanent-quality materials. For standards on permanent
paper see Executive Order No. 293 and Supervisor of Public Records Directive 2-93. For standards on microfilm see
950 CMR 39.00.

2. In creating permanent written records, custodians shall use recording materials i.e., ink, toner, etc. that meet the
following performance standards. Custodians shall utilize the best materials available in creating all government
records.

1. Lightfastness. Ink shall show no appreciable change when exposed to light, in a test comparable to the Fade-
ometer test, for 24 hours. Black inks that contain carbon do not fade, and are preferable for permanent records.

2. Water resistance. Ink shall demonstrate high water resistance ability of the image to resist deformation or change
in color with immersion in water. No obvious effects shall be seen when test strips are immersed in water and
various chemicals for 1/2 hour.

3. Alkalinity. Ink should have a neutral or slightly alkaline pH (7.0-8.5) to prevent damage to either the paper or the
writing implement.

4. Fluidity. Liquid ink shall produce good line continuity without splitting, excessive deposits of ink on the paper or
writing tip, variations of lines width and intensity, agglomerates of undispersed pigment or other undesirable writing
characteristics.

3. Additionally, recording materials and their use shall conform to the following standards:

1. Writing Ink. The ink shall be of such chemical composition as to be compatible with all components with which it
comes in contact. The ink shall not corrode the ball or writing tip of the pen, and shall contain no undissolved
particles of dye or agglomerates of undispersed pigments, except particles necessary to provide reproducibility in
black ink. The ink shall not be adversely affected by the ink cartridge, or vice versa. Ink cartridges shall start making




                                                           117
a line within a distance of 0.5 inch. On subsequent lines cartridges shall start making a line immediately. Writing
shall not feather or spread. It shall not penetrate to the reverse side of the paper or legibly transfer to another sheet of
paper. All colors shall be capable of reproduction by microfilming, and black ink shall be capable of reproduction by
thermography, dry copying and direct-image offset processes.

2. Xerographic Toners. Liquid toners for xerographic reproductions have been found to be more suitable for archival
applications than dry toners as the liquid toner is absorbed into the paper fiber. When copies are being created for
long term or permanent retention they should be created on xerographic machines using the liquid toner process.

3. Laser and Dot Matrix Printing. Dot matrix printing, which uses a cloth ribbon and pounds the ink into the paper
fiber, creates a more permanent bond than laser printing, which uses a dry toner that can flake. When permanent
records are being created on word processors they should be printed on dot matrix printers.

     Security and Custody of Records Created Outside the Town Hall
TO: Public Records Custodians
SUBJECT: Security and Custody of Records Created Outside the Town Hall
EXPIRATION DATE: Until superseded
PURPOSE: This bulletin provides guidance and requirements for security and custody of municipal records created
outside of Town Hall.

BACKGROUND:

Municipal governments have a fundamental obligation to provide secure storage for their records and make them
accessible to the general public. Business in some municipalities must be conducted outside town hall; this may lead
to situations where records are used and stored outside the premises of a municipal building in unsecured space,
leading, in some instances, to alienation of the record. In some instances, original records are removed from a
municipal building by a records custodian and stored in a private home or office. Such practices may jeopardize the
security and accessibility of the records and hinder proper records management procedures.

FINDINGS:

The Supervisor of Public Records is responsible for seeing that the records of the Commonwealth, counties, cities
and towns are put in the custody and condition required by law and securing their preservation. See G. L. 66, § 1
(the Supervisor’s responsibility to ensure preservation of the records of the Commonwealth, counties, cities and
towns). Municipal officials are responsible for the safekeeping of records in their custody. See G. L. 66, §§ 11 and
12. Therefore, the Supervisor directs municipal officials to take the following actions to provide security for and
access to public records.

ACTIONS:

1. Whenever original public records are removed from a municipal office by a records custodian for use in the
regular course of business in a private office or home, they shall be stored in fire resistant devices and safes provided
by the municipality.

2. If a custodian cannot insure fire resistant storage outside the municipal building then no original records may be
removed. However, the custodian may create copies of records for use in a private office or home.

3. Whenever original records are created outside the municipal offices, they shall be transferred on a regular and
frequent basis to secure storage in the municipal building. If secure storage is available in the custodian’s private
office or home, then copies of records shall be made and stored in the municipal building.

4. Whenever a records custodian finds it necessary to work in another location other that the municipal building, he
shall make himself available during regular posted office hours at a location convenient to the public.

5. Whenever an official relinquishes his office, he shall deliver over to his successor all such records he is not
authorized by law to retain. See G. L. c. 66, § 14.

        Requirement to Manage Records Created Under Government
                               Contracts
TO: Public Records Custodians
SUBJECT: Requirement to Manage Records Created Under Government Contracts
EXPIRATION DATE: Until superseded
PURPOSE: This bulletin provides guidance and requirements for the creation, management, accessibility, and
retention of records created under government contracts.

BACKGROUND:

The purpose of laws regulating the management of government records is to protect the rights and obligations of the
government and its citizens. Proper management of records ensures that the government has immediate access to
information for the full period of time it is needed to conduct daily business, financial transactions, litigation,
maintenance of public property, and development and implementation of public policy. Access to information also
secures the public’s prerogative to monitor the government and encourage its accountability to the governed.

Records documenting the provision of services by government are the responsibility of the government records
custodian. The custodian is required to use permanent-quality paper, inks, and materials to create permanent public
records (see: G. L. c. 66, §§ 3-4; also, Executive Order 293); secure and preserve records (see: G. L. c. 66, §§ 8-9,
11-12); provide public access to records (see: G. L. c. 4, § 7, cl. 26; c. 66, § 10); and dispose of records according to
disposal schedules approved by the Records Conservation Board for state government records or by the Supervisor
of Public Records for county and municipal government records (see: G. L. c. 66, § 8).

Rather than offering direct services to citizens, governments may choose to expend government funds to provide
services through vendors. These interactions result in the creation of much documentation, including information
about vendor qualifications, financial records relating to contracts and payment, reports to the contracting
government entity, and information about programs and their constituents.

Records resulting from contracted activities are vital to the conduct of government functions. For example, certain
records are required for contract monitoring, litigation, the prevention of fraud and abuse, and the fulfillment of
obligations to citizens served by programs. Because such documentation is critical to ensuring accountability, when
in government offices it is routinely accessible to citizens. Therefore, when services are provided through vendors
and such records are created and stored in contractors’ offices, the same standard applies. This change in location
does not abrogate the government’s obligation to ensure public accountability and public access to these government
records.

FINDINGS:

The Supervisor of Public Records is mandated to oversee the creation, preservation, accessibility, security, and
custody of public records (see: G. L. c. 66, § 1 et seq; 950 CMR 32).

When public monies are expended to provide government services to citizens, the public has an interest in the
information and records that result. Such records are government records and shall be managed in all respects
according to law.

Custodians must provide proper care and management of public records (see: G. L. c. 66, § 1 et seq.). A custodian is
defined as a “...person having routine access to or control of public records.” (see: 950 CMR 32.03) When a
government entity contracts with a vendor to provide government services, the vendor is acting for the government,
performing a government function with government funds. The government is considered custodian of certain
information generated to fulfill contractual obligations and has a direct interest in the proper management of the
resulting records.



                                                           121
ACTIONS:

1. Any government entity entering into a contract, grant agreement, or other agreement with any private entity to
provide government services shall include provisions in said agreement describing the creation, security,
accessibility, disposition, and custody of records created to satisfy the agreement. All records created in fulfillment
of the obligations of the contract are government records and shall be deliverable to the contracting government
entity.

2. In the agreement the government entity may enumerate records to be created and specify the media in which
information is recorded. Permanent-quality media shall be used to create permanent records.

3. The government entity shall describe in the agreement the actions to be taken by the contractor to ensure the
physical and intellectual security of the information created under the agreement.

4. Access provisions contained in the agreement shall conform to G. L. c. 4, § 7, cl. 26; c. 66, § 10, c. 66A, and other
pertinent statutes. In no case shall the agreement provide for more stringent restrictions on access than those
contained in law. Records systems incorporating electronic media must provide for access to publicly-available
information. Access provisions shall include the requirement that public requests for information be made through
the contracting government entity.

5. No government records may be destroyed without authorization. Therefore, the government entity shall reference
in the agreement any existing disposal schedules approved by the Records Conservation Board for state government
records or by the Supervisor of Public Records for local government records which may apply to information
created under the agreement. The agreement shall provide for the establishment of new disposal schedules for all
records not appearing on existing schedules.

6. Where records are deemed to be of permanent value, the government entity shall designate the media in which
information is to be created and/or maintained. Provisions shall be made for appropriate storage and preservation of
permanent records by the contractor while in his possession and for their return to the government entity as legal
custodian once their usefulness to the contractor ceases. Such records may be transferred to the Massachusetts
Archives for permanent retention.

                          Maintenance of Records Storage Areas
TO: Public Records Custodians
SUBJECT: Maintenance of Records Storage Areas
EXPIRATION DATE: Until superseded
PURPOSE: This bulletin provides guidance and requirements for records handling practices and maintenance of
dedicated records storage areas.

BACKGROUND:

Paper, magnetic media, photographic film, and other records are subject to continual change and decay. The rate of
change is determined by the environment in which they are housed. Environmental characteristics such as light,
temperature, humidity and air quality influence the condition and overall longevity of records and the information
they contain. Handling, the human aspect of the environment, has a powerful impact on the longevity of records.
When careless retrieval or refiling practices result in torn, crumpled or folded pages, paper fibers are broken, making
tears more likely in the future. Magnetic media requires thoughtful handling or data loss will result. Smoking,
eating, and drinking are equally as hazardous to records.

Dedicated records storage fulfills a unique function in office areas; the purpose of such storage is the protection and
preservation of public records. By its nature, this function is compromised by eating, drinking, smoking, and related
activities which expose records to fire, smoke, grease, oil, dirt, and other hazards.

FINDINGS:

The Supervisor of Public Records oversees the preservation of public records. See G. L. c.66, §1 (the Supervisor’s
responsibility to secure the preservation of the records of the commonwealth, counties, cities or towns). Public
officials are responsible for the safekeeping of the records in their custody. See G. L. c.66, §11. Therefore, the
supervisor charges public officials to provide proper handling and care of public records.

ACTIONS:

1. The use of smoking materials and the consumption of foods and beverages in dedicated records storage areas is
prohibited.

2. Dedicated records storage areas should be kept clean and free of environmental hazards to records. In the case of
storage areas shared by multiple offices, the executive officer should appoint an individual to monitor conditions,
report and correct violations.

3. All persons should refrain from smoking and consumption of foodstuffs when handling records.

4. Officials should take reasonable care in referencing, retrieving, and refiling records so that the physical
composition of the record, and the information it contains, is not damaged.

5. When planning the construction or refurbishment of a dedicated records storage area, officials should consult
Specifications for Safes and Vaults, available from this office. Specifications describe requirements for the
construction of vaults; temperature and humidity levels to be maintained in them; sprinkler, heating, ventilation and
air conditioning systems to be used; appropriate storage equipment; and related matters.

                                 Technical Bulletin 1
                       Performance Standards of Safes and Vaults
Issued by the Supervisor of Public Records
May 18, 1995
Version 2 (1996)

AUTHORITY

Chapter 66, s.11 MGL requires the officers in charge of state departments, county commissioners, city councils or
selectmen to provide fire-resistant rooms, safes or vaults for the safekeeping of the public records of their
governmental unit (2 Op. Atty. Gen. 1899, p. 48). Pursuant to § 1 of this statute, the Supervisor of Public Records is
authorized to promulgate standards for the construction and use of these vaults, rooms and safes (8 Op. Atty. Gen.
1929, p. 594).

EFFECTIVE DATE

These performance standards become effective on May 18, 1995.

GENERAL

All vaults for the storage of public records shall provide the minimum level of protection specified hereunder. The
Supervisor of Public Records does not specify any particular materials or technique for the construction of public
records vaults. The Supervisor will approve vaults for the storage of public records upon receipt of the certification
of licensed or registered fire protection and structural engineers that the proposed construction will have a fire
resistance and structural integrity equivalent to or greater than that specified in the following performance criteria.

SIZE

A vault size of 5,000 cubic feet or less is considered optimal. Where large volumes of records must be protected, it
is permissible to construct a vault with a capacity of up to 25,000 cubic feet. It must be realized that, because of the
volume of combustible materials stored within it, this larger structure is at greater risk of fire and should be
equipped with a fire suppression system.

MEDIA PROTECTION

All vaults intended for the storage of paper records shall be so constructed that, when fitted with the 6-hour required
hereunder shall, in the event of fire in the surrounding structure, maintain an internal temperature of 350 or below
for a period of not less than 6 hours. These standards provide the maximum available level of fire protection for
paper records, but cannot safeguard film or magnetic media against either hear or humidity. If magnetic media have
not been copies and dispersed or otherwise duplicated for protection, vaults or portions thereof used for the storage
of this media must be equipped with data safes or an inner core designed to minimize temperature rise and moisture
intrusion. These safes and cores shall be so constructed or equipped that, in the even of fire in the surrounding
structure, the internal temperature and relative humidity shall remain below 125 and 80%, respectively for a period
of at least 2 hours. It is the responsibility of the records custodian to provide all media with the level of protection
specified above and to provide the Supervisor with the engineer’s certification to that effect.

CONSTRUCTION

Except in Type I or Type II-222 fire resistive construction as defined by NFPA 220, Standard on Types of Building
Construction, all vaults shall be ground-supported and structurally independent of surrounding structures.
Supporting structures for vaults shall be sufficient to support the full weight of the vault structure and its contents.




                                                          125
Since shrinkage or volume change, stresses may result in hairline cracking that will be detrimental to the vault
structure, all concrete members should have a minimum reinforcing as specified in the ACI Code, and all masonry
walls should have minimum reinforcing as specified in Paragraph 1113.5.3 of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
State Building Code.

All building members supporting the vault shall be noncombustible. All structure materials used in the construction
of a vault shall have a fire resistance rating of 6 hours. All interior fittings and finish shall be noncombustible.

If connected to the building in any manner, the connection shall be made so that in the event of the collapse of the
building, the surrounding building members may move or fall without affecting the fire-resistive qualities of the
vault. All beams or bearing members adjoining the vault shall be designed to release freely in case of failure. Vault
construction shall not be used as a support or bearing for the structural members of the building. Walls shall have
sufficient lateral strength to withstand impact of collapsing building members, or toppling machinery or equipment.

Construction of vaults below grade level should be avoided whenever possible because of the dangers posed by the
“cooking” effect of fallen debris, flooding from natural causes or fire fighting efforts, and the difficulties of
maintaining proper environmental control.

In non-fire resistive buildings, the vault roof shall be designed to accommodate a minimum live load of 350 pounds
per square foot. In all cases, ample accommodation should be made for protection against impact loading by falling
equipment or building members and against accumulations of burning debris.

WATERTIGHTNESS

Walls, roofs and floors shall be effectively waterproofed. No combustible membrane or coating shall be used except
on a roof exposed to the weather.

Provisions shall be made to prevent the entry of water at door openings.

Ample drainage shall be provided to prevent rain or fire fighting water accumulating on the roof.

PENETRATION

Wall penetrations shall be allowed only for access, HVAC systems, sprinkler systems, electric lighting and limited
energy circuits. Wall openings shall be as small as possible and shall be sealed with approved or listed fire-rated
materials and devices to prevent smoke, heat, flame or water penetration. Conduit, if used, shall be sealed inside and
outside.

Roofs shall not be pierced for any purpose.

Floors shall not be pierced, except that floors of vaults constructed on grade may be pierced to allow the passage of
sprinkler piping or HVAC ducts.

VAULT DOORS

All vault doors shall be Underwriters’ Laboratories Class 350 rated 6 hours or equivalent. ORDINARY FIRE
DOORS SUCH AS HOLLOW METAL, TINCLAD, SHEET METAL, OR METALCLAD TYPES; STEEL
PLATE TPE AND FILE ROOM DOORS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE AS VAULT DOORS.

Vault doors shall be equipped with combination-type locks with an Underwriters’ Laboratories approved relocking
device designed to hold the door in case of mechanical, explosive or torch attack on the door. The lock mechanism
shall be of the type enabling a person locked inside the vault to open the door easily from the inside. All day gates
shall be similarly equipped.



                                                         126
Vault doors shall be equipped with smoke or heat-actuated release mechanisms to close them in case of fire.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL

For paper and magnetic media, a stable environment with an average temperature of 70F or below and an average
relative humidity of 30-50% shall be maintained. A temperature below 70F and a relative humidity of 40-45%, with
fluctuations limited to no more than +2 F and +3% RH, is considered optimal. Storage facilities for first-generation
silver halide microfilm shall maintain a constant temperature of below 70F and relative humidity of between 20 and
30%. If it is not possible to meet these optima, minimization of temperature and humidity fluctuations shall be the
guiding concern. These parameters should be accomplished by controlling the external environment surrounding the
storage space. Where this is not feasible, the storage space may be equipped with a heating/ventilation/air
conditioning system. All equipment related to such a system shall be located outside the storage space.

FIRE DETECTION SYSTEMS

Automatic fire detection systems shall be installed in accordance with NFPA 71, Signaling Systems for Central
Station Service; NFPA 72, Protective Signaling Systems; and NFPA 72E, Automatic Fire Detectors. The systems
shall be relied on only when there is an assurance that the alarms will bring prompt response at all times.

FIRE SUPPRESSION SYSTEMS

Vaults may be equipped with automatic sprinkler protection installed in accordance with NFPA 13, Standard for the
Installation of Sprinkler Systems.

Class A fire extinguishers or a standpipe systems with a small hose, suitable for use by the occupants of the
building, shall be provided in a convenient location outside the vault door.

WIRING AND LIGHTING

All wiring shall be in conformance with NFPA 70, National Electrical Code. Fixed lighting only shall be provided in
the vault. Lighting shall be limited to explosion proof or vapor proof lamps and controlled only from a 2-pole switch
located outside the vault.

SHELVING

All shelving shall be of noncombustible construction and as fully enclosed as possible. All shelving shall be a
minimum of 3 inches above the floor of the vault. Electrically powered mobile shelving shall not be installed.

Records and containers shall be separated by at lest 6 inches from any piping or conduits within the vault. Where
sprinklers have been installed, a clearance of 18 inches shall be maintained below sprinkler heads.

SAFES AND RECORD CONTAINERS

Safes and insulated record containers to be used for the storage of paper records shall provide protection equivalent
to that of Underwriters’ Laboratory Class 350, rated for 4 hours. Equipment for storage of magnetic and
photographic media shall be Class 150 rated 2 hours. Combinations of equipment or the use of inserts or liners to
achieve equivalent levels of protection are permitted. Ratings by recognized testing laboratories other than
Underwriters’ Laboratories shall be recognized.




                                                         127
CERTIFICATION TO SUPERVISOR OF PUBLIC RECORDS

Prior to storage of public records in a newly constructed or renovated vault, the contracting agency shall provide the
Supervisor of Public Records with signed and sealed certifications from all relevant engineers that the foregoing
standards have been met or exceeded. No vaults which are not so certified may be used for the storage of public
records.

                                            Records Security
Version 2 (1999)

PURPOSE

Two of the prime responsibilities of records custodians are ensuring the physical security of the operational records
and preserving the corporate memory of the agency/department.

Loss of records can result in:

* Disruption of government business and services.
* Legal risks and excessive legal bills.
* Severe operational and financial setbacks.
* Damage to the interests of the constituency.
* Loss of political and historical context and legitimacy.

There are also legal repercussions if the custodian’s responsibilities have been clearly enunciated. Failure to provide
for the security of records in the face of clear requirements to do so may well be interpreted as negligence.

Threats to Records

Records custodians have a responsibility to protect their records against a variety of threats including fire, flood,
theft, vandalism, pests and environmental damage. In the past, this was relatively straightforward: today,
advancements in storage technologies and a proliferation of record media have complicated the task.

Environment

Now records custodians must provide protection for a variety of media, including paper, photographic film and
magnetic media. Each recording media has its own environmental requirements and limits at which irreversible
degradation will occur. These requirements must be taken into consideration when planning for the security of
public records.

Paper

Paper is the most durable of recording mediums. While paper can survive temperatures up to 350EF., humidity
levels up to 100%, or total immersion in water, only a stable environment will assure long-term security and
preservation. Temperatures below 70EF. and relative humidity of 40-45% are optimal. Due to the difficulty and
expense of meeting these criteria, it is permissible to maintain average vault temperatures of 70EF. or below and an
average relative humidity of 30-50%, with daily fluctuations of ±2EF. and ±3%RH. The Supervisor of Public
Records publication Performance Standards for Safes and Vaults mandates that in the event of a fire, storage spaces
with public records may not exceed the upper limit of 350o for the duration of a fire.

Photographic Film

Silver halide microfilm masters require a constant temperature of 70EF. or below and a relative humidity of 20-30%
for long-term preservation. It is preferable that temperatures do not exceed 65EF, and cooler temperatures are
preferable. Storage space designed for the protection of paper records is not sufficient for the low humidity storage
requirements of film. Storage requirements for film are specified in 950 CMR 39.06 of Regulations on Using
Microfilm.




                                                             129
Magnetic media

Magnetic media has a much lower tolerance for high heat and humidity levels than paper. Magnetic media begins to
suffer severe degradation at 150EF. and relative humidity of 85% and above. Storage space designed for the
protection of paper records cannot protect magnetic media from the heat of a fire or the moisture generated by fire-
suppression efforts. Periodic copying and dispersal of media, and specialized Class 150 records storage devices or
vaults are necessary for the protection of magnetic media; please see the “Records Storage Equipment” section for
more details. Storage devices and vaults must meet the guidelines specified in the Supervisor of Public Records
publication Performance Standards for Safes and Vaults.

Please see the Records Management Unit’s Web page at www.sec.state.ma.us/arc/arcrmu for a copy of the
publications mentioned, or contact the RMU (617-727-2816 or recman@sec.state.ma.us) for a paper copy. For more
information, please see the “Environment” section of Northeast Document Conservation Center’s Preservation of
Library and Archival Materials at www.nedcc.org/index2.htm

Dirt and Pollutants

Cleanliness of the vault is essential to the protection of the records. Dust and pollutants can damage records and are
sources of ignition. Unsanitary conditions are a hazard and are a breeding ground for insects and vermin. Prohibit
food, drink and plants from the vault. Remove trash daily, and do not allow collected trash to accumulate in areas
directly outside the building.

Protect archival records from dust and pollutants by housing them in archival-quality folders and boxes. The folders
and boxes should meet the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard for permanence, Z39.48-1992.
The alkaline reserve serves as a buffer between the contents and a potentially harsh environment. Boxes and folders
meeting the ANSI standard will create a stable micro-environment for permanent records. For more information,
please see the “Storage” section of this publication.

Maintain an overall environment that is as dust-free as possible:

* Change furnace and air conditioner filters on a regular schedule, e.g., quarterly.
* Use vacuum cleaners equipped with high-efficiency, particulate air (HEPA) filters if possible, so as not to
redistribute dust. Sweeping is discouraged, since it stirs up and scatters dirt.
* Avoid introducing materials that create internal pollutants, such as wooden cabinets and shelves, cleaning
compounds, and carpeting.
* Do not store records near copying machines, which produce ozone and toner dust. Records should be properly
boxed and shelved. Boxes should not hang over shelf edges. Records should be promptly returned to their boxes;
boxes should be promptly reshelved. Lit tobacco products, matches or lighters should be prohibited from the vault.

Cleaning compounds with ammonia, chlorine, solvents or volatile oils should not be used in the vault. Typically dust
cloths and water are sufficient. Use caution with water because of the risk of spills and raising the relative humidity
in a confined area. Make sure shelves are completely dry prior to reshelving. For more information, please see
Northeast Document Conservation Center’s technical leaflet “Cleaning Books and Shelves” at
www.nedcc.org/tleaf43.htm.

Insects and Vermin

Pests indicate an environmental problem such as high humidity or gaps in the building structure, or poor
housekeeping. Unless there is a specific problem, avoid regularly scheduled chemical treatments. Chemicals emit
strong odors that may create long-term problems for staff, records, and record users.

There is no all-purpose solution for eliminating every pest problem. Practice a preventive approach to pest
management. Maintain good housekeeping, prohibit food, beverages and plants, monitor the environment, use the




                                                         130
least toxic eradication methods first, and work with your pest control professional. A pest infestation inside records
boxes indicates a serious condition. Call the Records Management Unit at 617-727-2816 immediately.

Light

Artificial and natural light causes irreparable and irreversible damage. Vault areas should not have windows: if
records are in an environment where they are exposed to light, cover windows with shades or drapes that completely
block the light. This will also help maintain a stable temperature. Turn off interior lights when they are not in use
and install ultraviolet (UV) filters on florescent lights. Store archival records in archival-quality folders and boxes.

Photocopiers are a powerful source of light. Avoid repeatedly copying the same record. Create “surrogates” or use
copies for heavily requested records. Provide users with surrogate copies to reduce wear and tear on originals.

Mold

Excessive heat, poor air circulation, and relative humidity above 65% can provide a suitable climate for mold
growth. If relative humidity goes over 65% for more than two days, or the airflow is stagnant, there is a risk of mold
growth. High humidity is especially problematic in basements, where ground water and cooler temperatures
encourage water vapor to collect. The appearance of mold indicates a serious condition and requires immediate
action.

If mold occurs, reduce the temperature and relative humidity. Do not move records or try to remove mold from
records without first consulting preservation personnel.

Determining the mold species is an important first step in addressing the mold outbreak. Some molds can present
very serious health concerns. Even dormant (dry or powdery) mold spores can be readily redistributed within a
storage space, becoming active (velvety) when environmental conditions are favorable for growth.

If you discover records with mold, immediately contact the Records Management Unit at 617-727-2816.

Records Storage Equipment

Records storage equipment and facilities should be designed and constructed to protect paper, photographic film and
magnetic media against catastrophic events such as fire or flood, malicious attack or theft, and against long-term
threats caused by environmental factors.

Storage units should be fire resistant in the sense of being noncombustible, and must be heat resistant, in order to
prevent degradation or auto-ignition of the records. Storage units must protect records against water intrusion and
high humidity levels. It is crucial that records storage units (vaults, records safes, or insulated files) prevent the
transfer of heat and that the storage units maintain their structural integrity.

Unrated devices including the so-called Old Line steel and cast iron safes found in many offices cannot be relied
upon to provide the required level of protection. Although Old Line safes have been known to survive serious fires,
they cannot be counted on to provide the heat-resistance or impact-resistance necessary to safeguard public records.
Old-fashioned steel plate vault doors, with or without inner doors, provide only 10 or 15 minutes of fire protection,
respectively. Unrated steel or wood filing cabinets, desks, etc., only provide 5 minutes of fire protection.

Storage equipment is tested by various testing laboratories e.g., Underwriters’ Laboratories and is classified in terms
of interior temperature limits and time in hours. For non-paper records, protective storage devices are classified 150
and rated 1, 2 or 4 hour e.g., the storage unit can maintain an internal temperature of 150EF. or below for 1, 2 or 4
hours. Units that are classified 150 require the maintenance of 80% or below internal relative humidity for the period
tested.




                                                          131
For paper records, devices are classified to 350o and rated 1, 2 or 4 hour, with an allowance for 100% internal
relative humidity. Devices may be equipped with inserts for greater fire resistance or for the storage of mixed media;
for example, a storage device for paper records may be fitted with small, internal units for magnetic media. These
devices may carry more than one classification and rating. The first classification applies to the whole unit and the
second classification applies to the insert, e.g. 350 4 hour/150 4 hour.

Ratings assigned to various records storage devices are as follows:

* Insulated Records Containers Class 150 rated for 4, 2 and 1 hour
* Class 350 rated for 4, 2 and 1 hour
* Fire-resistant Safes Class 350 rated for 4 and 2 hour
* Insulated Filing Devices Class 350 rated for 1 hour
* Insulated File Drawers Class 350 rated for 1 hour
* Vault Doors Class 350 rated for 6, 4 and 2 hour

Insulated File Room Doors Class 350 rated for 1 and 1/2 hour Since fires often result in the collapse of structures,
the fire-rated storage device must be able to withstand high impact e.g., the force of dropping through the building
floor. This is tested as part of the classification rating.

Vaults must be constructed to withstand the impact of falling building members, equipment and the stresses and
strains of collapsing structural members. Vaults must be constructed so that a fire will not: destroy the vault
structural supports; produce stresses that will cause the walls, floors or ceilings to crack; cause the vault to erode due
to sudden cooling from fire hose streams; and so that the vault will in no way lose its structural integrity.

It is undesirable to locate vaults and other record storage units in the basement of buildings, since burning debris
may accumulate in the basement and create a “cooking effect.” This leads to high temperatures for longer periods of
time than would otherwise be the case. Basement units are also more susceptible to the impact of falling equipment
and structural members. It is also more difficult to evacuate personnel from basement units.

In addition to fire-imposed hazards, basement areas are more prone to flooding and high humidity than areas at or
above grade. This increases the risk of environmental and preservation hazards.

VAULT OPERATIONS

Because of the expense and inherent size limitations of vault construction, it is crucial that the vault is utilized
effectively. The vault is specifically designed to ensure the safe preservation of the government records. Using the
vault for the storage of supplies, office machines, seasonal decorations, equipment or other non-record materials is a
waste of valuable and secure space, and is an egregious misuse of scarce government resources.

Secure space is a limited resource: care must be taken to determine which records are stored in the vault. In order to
make the most efficient use of vault space, public records should be prioritized as outlined in the following section,
“Vital Records Management.” Records that should be given priority for vault storage are records that are 1) vital to
the operation of the organization, or are 2) archival due to their historical value and importance for preserving
institutional and community memory. Secondary space allocations should be made for records appraised as
important. If the vault cannot accommodate all important or useful records, provisions should be made for their
storage in fire-resistant file rooms as specified in NFPA-232, Protection of Records.

When planning the size and location of a new or reconstructed vault, records custodians should consider the current
volume of records needing protection and attempt to estimate future space needs; this estimate should take into
account projected growth estimates for the community and the annual accumulation of each record series. In the
planning stage, it is appropriate to explore various avenues for reducing the growth of records e.g., miniaturization,
electronic archiving of electronic records, and implementation of a comprehensive information management
program and review.




                                                           132
Since vital records are usually active records, consider the needs of all involved and ensure convenient access to the
vault. It may be desirable to construct two or more small vaults that are readily accessible to the operational offices,
rather than a single large vault that is distant and inconvenient to access.

Supervision and Control

The vault should be under responsible supervision at all times. If the vault is not under constant surveillance, it
should be closed and locked at all times it is not in use. Only authorized personnel should be allowed access to the
vault: the authorization procedure should be documented in the record management policies and procedures manual,
and it should designate which individuals are authorized to deposit or remove records. The vault should be inspected
several times a day and at closing time to ensure that all records are properly shelved, all waste papers are removed,
and that the door is closed and locked.

Removal of records should be controlled through the use of a sign-out or charge-out system. An example is the use
of an outguide, a stiff cardboard divider with a protruding tab, which is placed in the box in place of the folder. The
outguide should be ruled and labeled so that the worker may write in the file name, his name and the date the file
was removed. There are many variations of sign-out systems ranging from basic lists to the use of bar codes.
Whatever system is decided on, it should be documented in the records management policies and procedures
manual.

It is highly recommended that a single officer or employee be placed in charge of the vault. This individual should
have the authority to: control access to and change the combination; allocate space; establish requirements for
boxing and labeling records; accept or reject records to be stored, based on the vital records program; and require the
removal or rescheduling of records that have exceeded the required retention period.

Equipment

All filing equipment should be noncombustive throughout. If mobile shelving is installed, it must be of the
mechanical type. Only equipment needed to service the files should be allowed in the vault. Desks, chairs and other
furniture should be forbidden. If possible, ladders needed to reach upper shelves should be stored outside the vault;
ladders should only be brought into the vault as needed. In the event of a fire or other emergency, the vault lights
will probably fail, and it is essential that the vault aisles are kept clear. Aisles cluttered with boxes or equipment
present a safety hazard.

Filing cabinets provide extremely inefficient storage and should not be used. Optimize space with shelving: shelving
allows five times as much storage per square foot as equivalent office space. High-density shelving allows ten to
twelve times as much storage per square as equivalent office space. Shelving should be designed for standard-size
record boxes (typically 10” x 12” x 15”), as this will maximize the use of space.

Shelves that are closed on the ends and that have a front closure system, and mobile shelving in the compressed
position, provide additional protection against fire and water damage from sprinkler heads or fire suppression. These
systems also reduce air circulation, which may lead to mold growth. If closed systems are chosen, the environment
should be carefully monitored.

Storage

All files should be properly arranged prior to boxing: only important records should be sent to the vault. Remove
duplicate records and other non-essential materials. Record boxes should be of uniform size and clearly labeled with
the office of origin, contents and span and disposal dates. For a sample inventory database (including box labels),
please see the “Tools and Models” section of the Records Management Unit Web page at
www.magnet.state.ma.us/sec/arc/arcrmu/arctoo.htm. In order to prevent mixing records with different offices of
origin, each office should be assigned its own storage area in the vault.




                                                          133
Record containers should be at least 6 inches from piping and conduit that penetrates the wall. Record containers
should be at least 4 inches from the wall to allow for maximum air circulation. Record containers should be kept a
minimum of 18 inches below sprinkler deflectors. All records should be stored on shelves that are a minimum of 3
inches above the floor of the vault.

Storage Boxes and Enclosures for Permanent Paper Records

Paper records should be stored in archival-quality folders and boxes (low lignin or lignin-free, buffered, pH 8.5 or
above). The folders should be stored in archival-quality boxes with lids. The calcium carbonate “buffer” of archival-
quality materials prevents the formation of acid in paper records.

Select the appropriate-sized boxes and folders for paper records. Do not overstuff folders, and do not bend the
materials to fit the folder or box. Folders should stand upright in the box. If necessary, use archival-quality fillers to
support the folders and to prevent them from falling over.

Mark folders in pencil: pen and labels are chemically unstable and labels will fall off. Purchase supplies from
companies that specialize in archival products. Contact the Northeast Document Conservation Center at 978-470-
1010 or see their technical leaflet “Preservation Suppliers and Services” at www.nedcc.org/listsup.htm for a list of
suppliers. Also see the Massachusetts Historical Records Advisory Boards (MHRAB) technical leaflet “Preservation
Basics” at www.magnet.state.ma.us/sec/arc/arcaac/aacipre.htm.

VITAL RECORDS MANAGEMENT

There is a small percentage of information within any organization that is crucial to the successful operation of the
organization. Without this information, the organization cannot function. These records are the vital records of the
organization.

Although vital records typically constitute 3-5% of the organization’s total information stock and may have only
short-term value, vital records are essential for the:

* Operation of the organization

* Resumption or continuation of operations following a disaster

* Re-establishment of the legal, financial and functional status of the organization

* Determination and protection of the rights and obligations of the employees and citizens. Loss of this information
can result in: vulnerability to litigation; exposure to unplanned financial losses due to financial settlements or
revenue loss; disruption of the continuity of operations; loss of efficiency; and damage to the interests of the citizens
and employees of the organization.

The objective of vital records management is to minimize risks and hazards to vital information, and to do so in the
most efficient and economical manner possible. In the public sector, vital records programs protect the public
interest, ensure the maintenance of individual rights, and preserve the public trust.




                                                           134
Establishing a Vital Records Program

Before implementing a comprehensive plan to safeguard vital records, the organization must complete a thorough
study of its records. This study should include: determination of records classification; physical volume by class;
storage space requirements; costs of the loss of each class; protection needed; and handling procedures.

Records Classification

Records are generally classified in one of four groups in a scheme suggested by the National Fire Prevention
Association:

CLASS DEFINITION EXAMPLE

RECOMMENDED

PROTECTION

Class I

Vital Records essential to the continued life of the organization. These records are irreplaceable because they give
evidence of legal and financial status, and of the rights and obligations of the organization. Vital records are
generally housed in active storage. Accounts receivable, contracts, charters, minutes, payroll, ordinances and
resolutions, master personnel listings, all documentation needed to run and read electronic records systems. Fire
resistant vaults and safes, dispersal.

Class II

Important Records necessary to the continued life of the organization. While the records can be replaced or
reproduced, this can only be done at considerable cost in time and money. These records may be housed in either
active or inactive storage. Accounts payable, tax lists, directives. Fire resistant safes, vaults or file rooms.

Class III

Useful

Records useful to the continued life of the organization.

These records may be replaced although their loss would cause temporary inconvenience. Bank statements,
correspondence. Fire resistant safes, file rooms, filing devices.

Class IV

Non-essential Records that have no present value and should be destroyed. Requests answered, advertisements,
announcements. Use, then destroy.

Although there is a tendency to equate vital records with records that have historic or archival value, they are not
always one and the same. The life span of vital records may be very brief, and may inversely proportional to its
importance to the organization. While archival records have enduring interest and historical value, they may not be
relevant to the continued functioning of the governmental unit.

Documentation of computer systems, accounts receivable and insurance policy information are essential to restoring
operations after a disaster, even though this information may have a brief usable life or retention period. On the




                                                            135
other hand, records such as militia lists, Civil War records, and pre-1870 correspondence have historical interest and
should be retained permanently, but they are not essential to the resumption or maintenance of government
operations. The vital and archival categories are not mutually exclusive: records frequently fall into both categories.
Since the protection of vital records should take precedence over other records, vital records classifications should
be carefully assigned.

Protection Methods

To determine the most appropriate level of vital records protection, estimate the severity of potential disasters. The
severity of the disaster, costs of protection, and budgetary levels will dictate the level of protection. There are two
means of protection available to local governments in Massachusetts: on-site storage, and duplication and dispersal.

1. On-site storage

Considerations for on-site storage of vital records include the analysis and improvement of buildings or facilities,
equipment and supplies, and establishing procedural controls.

1. Building considerations. Establish the adequacy of the floor-load capacity, lighting, ventilation, environmental
controls, wall and door fire ratings, smoke and fire alarms and fire suppression systems. Eliminate hazards such as
leaks and pest infestation.

2. Equipment considerations. Determine whether the vaults, safes and storage devices meet or exceed Underwriters’
Laboratories specifications. Underwriters’ Laboratories tests and rates storage and filing equipment on the basis of
impact resistance and internal fire and humidity levels during various lengths of exposure to fire. As a general rule,
paper begins to deteriorate at 350EF., and magnetic media and photographs begin to deteriorate at 150EF. Storage
devices for magnetic media must also be able to maintain an internal relative humidity of below 85%. See the “Vault
Operations: Equipment” section for more details.

3. Procedural considerations. Routinely update vital records; prohibit food, beverages and smoking in records areas;
do not store combustible materials with records; conduct periodic electrical, building and fire inspections; and
periodically test the vital records program through simulation of post-disaster scenarios. See the “Vault Operations”
section for routine procedural considerations.

The vital records program should not rely exclusively on on-site storage: there is always the risk that a single area
can be destroyed or suffer near total destruction in a disaster. Duplication and dispersal of vital records must be part
of the vital records program.

2. Duplication and Dispersal

Off-site storage of original, record copies of public records is forbidden under Massachusetts statutes. Duplication of
vital records and storing the copies away from the central or primary office if one method of protecting vital records.
This strategy is most effective for records that have been microfilmed and for records that are maintained in
electronic format.

The environmental requirements for storing master microfilm negatives are very stringent; see the “Threats to
Records” section for more detail. To ensure the safety of master microfilm and to ensure proper environmental
controls, consider storing the master negatives with the Massachusetts State Records Center or with a private
vendor. The State Records Center provides this service free of charge; please see the Additional Information section
for contact information. In the event of a disaster, the off-site repository should be able to rapidly retrieve and copy
the master negative. The master negative should never be used as a use copy. The master copy should only be used
to produce duplicate film.




                                                          136
Electronic records should be backed up at frequent intervals; see the Records Management Unit publications for
more detail. Backup copies should be stored off-site; reciprocal arrangements should be made between offices to
store their backup copies. Programs and documentation needed to retrieve and read the backup copies should be
secured at an off-site location. Agencies and departments should be aware of others who are using the same
hardware and software: in the event of a disaster, it may be possible to utilize their hardware and/or software.
Electronic archiving may also be investigated as a security measure.

In all cases, the dispersed records should be retained for their full retention periods and should be made available to
the appropriate officers.

Program Staff

The Vital Records Coordinator

If the office already has a comprehensive records management program, the records manager is the most appropriate
person to coordinate the vital records protection program. If a comprehensive records management program does not
exist, appoint a coordinator who has experience with records management e.g., a staff member of the Clerk’s office.
It is essential that all members of the organization recognize the authority of the coordinator: the coordinator should
act with the administration’s authority and should have authority over vital records for all departments.

Most local governments have emergency response procedures for dealing with disasters. Public safety, public works
and other personnel are all assigned a role in safeguarding lives and property. These procedures typically do not
involve a long-term plan for preserving information and restoring severely disrupted operations, except for physical
services such as water, electricity and public safety. A vital records program should be designed to preserve
information that is essential to governmental functions. The vital records program should be part of the emergency
response program and/or local disaster plans. The vital records coordinator should be part of the overall emergency
planning process.

The Vital Records Team

The vital records team assists the program coordinator and is an important part of a successful vital records program.
The major function of the team is to help the coordinator determine which functions and supporting records are vital
to the organization, and to ensure that they are properly safeguarded. Administration, finance, law, information
systems, and records management experience are important background for team members.

Communications

All officials should be aware of the importance of their vital records, and how critical they are to the survival of the
organization. In larger organizations, it may be desirable to have a vital records manual; smaller organizations may
find a simple master list to be sufficient. Vital records should be designated on the master records inventory. It is
essential that the vital records program is part of management policy.

Summary

A vital records management program:

* Prevents the loss of information that is critical to the daily operations of government organizations.
* Begins with a records inventory that describes the function of the record within the organization.
* Classifies records into one of four categories: vital, important, useful or nonessential.
* Selects appropriate protection methods to safeguard vital records.
* Permits the organization to continue functioning during a disaster and to reestablish services after the disaster.
* Should be part of management policy, and should be part of community emergency response and local disaster
plans.

                            GLOSSARY OF SPECIAL TERMS
Administration/Administrative
These terms are often used to differentiate between routine work materials that include fiscal records
and policy, planning, and decision-making records.
Administrative Use
This term refers to the length of time a record retains its usefulness as determined by agency staff.
Such use is discretionary and does not require further input from the Records Management Unit. It is
not necessary to submit an RMU-2 destruction form for destruction of administrative use records,
unless otherwise noted in the schedule.
Appraisal
Appraisal describes the process of establishing the business, cultural, legal or historic value of a
record in order to establish its retention periods.
Archival Records
Archival Records are public records possessing legal or historic value and may not be destroyed.
Audit records
If items subject to audit are dated with the current fiscal year and have already been audited, they
should be retained through the end of the applicable fiscal year or later, as necessary. If items subject
to audit are dated with the current calendar year and have already been audited, they should be
retained through the end of the applicable calendar year or later, as necessary
Conservation
Conservation consists of repair or stabilization of materials through chemical or physical treatment to
assist in record preservation.
Contract
A contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties.
Custodian of Records
A custodian of records is the governmental officer or employee who in the normal course of his or
her duties has access to or control of public records. See 950 CMR 32.03.
Custody
Custody describes physical possession of records, and the responsibilities related to such possession.
Disposal
Disposal refers to the transfer of records, especially noncurrent records, to their final state, either
destruction or transfer to an archives.
Duplicate Copy
A duplicate copy is a copy made from an original record.
Electronic records
If an electronic record is the sole source of the information, it must be treated in the same manner as
its hard copy counterparts for the purposes of disposal and must be maintained in accordance with
the appropriate disposal schedule and record series.




                                                    167
Permanent
Permanent records must be retained and preserved indefinitely, in accordance with generally
accepted standards.
Record Copy
A record copy is a reproduction of a record, used for information sharing to protect original records
from harm.
Record Series
A record series is a set of records relating to a specific business process or function. Occasionally, a
record series is defined by the form of the records such as ‘maps’ or ‘photographs.’
Redaction
Redaction is the process of masking sensitive content of a record before making it available for
consultation.
Retention Schedule
A retention schedule is a comprehensive instruction covering the disposition of records to assure that
they are retained for as long as necessary based on their administrative, fiscal, legal and historic
value.
Settlement of levy
If the phrase settlement of levy is used in the disposition section of the disposal schedule, it
designates the closure of all accounts for a particular levy through payment, abatement or taking of
property for taxes.
Transitory Records
Transitory records do not possess any enduring value and are not covered by any particular record
series in this Manual. Examples of transitory records include, but are not limited to general
announcement, out-of-office e-mail replies, thank you messages, published reference materials, and
news releases.
