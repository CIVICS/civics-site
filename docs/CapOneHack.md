* REGISTER: Sign Up with Capital One API allows you to access an OAuth 2.0 standard implementation for authorization, and use it to verify the identity of a user who is registering for your site.

* AUTHORIZE: Verify with Capital One is an identity-proofing product that allows you to match the personal information provided by one of your customers to the verified information of a Capital One customer.

* LOGIN: Our Sign In with Capital One API allows end customers to use their Capital One User ID and Password on integrated partner sites. This product includes a multi-factor authentication challenge and explicit customer consent. Leveraging Capital Oneʼs credentials also provides the benefit of strong authentication, device confidence and user verification.

* BANK/IDP REUSABLE IDENTITY/AUTHENTICATION/AUTHORIZATION: Solving Electronic Medical Records: Under HIPAA, a “covered entity” is required to implement procedures to verify that a person or entity seeking access to electronic protected health information is the person or entity claimed.  Substantially identical requirements exist for access to educational records (FERPA), personal data held by government (FIPA) and many other sectors (telecom, fair credit reporting, etc, etc).  

* We have demonstrated an approach to solve the HIPAA authentication barrier using the Capital One API Suite of Next Generation Identity Services. 
* This same general design pattern can serve as a reusable building block for Starbucks -  e-commerce, education, utilities, civic participation… anything where identity is required!  .
